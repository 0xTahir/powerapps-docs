# Create and manage a portal from PowerApps

With the capability to build a portal in PowerApps, you can create a website for external and internal users enabling them to interact with data stored in Common Data Service.

These are some benefits of building a portal:

- Because the data is stored in Common Data Service, you don't need to create a connection from PowerApps as you do with data sources such as SharePoint, Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps, or Salesforce. You need only to specify the entities that you want to show or manage in the portal.

- You can design the portal through the WYSIWYG maker experience by adding and configuring components on the webpages.
