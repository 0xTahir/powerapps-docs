# Preview disclaimer

Preview features are features that aren’t complete but are made available on a “preview” basis, so customers can get early access and provide feedback. Preview features are not supported by Microsoft Support, may have limited or restricted functionality, aren’t meant for production use, and may be available only in selected geographic areas.
