# What is PowerApps?

PowerApps is a suite of apps, services, connectors and data platform that provides a rapid application development environment to build custom apps for your business needs. Using PowerApps, you can quickly build custom business apps that connect to your business data stored *either* in the underlying data platform (**Common Data Service for Apps**) *or* to various online and on-premises data sources (SharePoint, Excel, Office 365, Dynamics 365, SQL Server, and so on). 

Apps built using PowerApps provide rich business logic and workflow capabilities to transform your manual business processes to digital, automated processes. Further, apps built using PowerApps have a responsive design, and can run seamlessly in browser or on mobile devices (phone or tablet). PowerApps "democratizes" the custom business app building experience by enabling users to build feature-rich, custom business apps without writing code.

PowerApps also provides an extensible platform that lets pro developers use code to create custom connectors, apply server-side logic using Azure functions, plug-ins, and workflow extensions, and integrate with external data using virtual entities and webhooks.

## PowerApps for app makers/creators

Using PowerApps, you can create two types of apps: **Canvas** and **model-driven**. More information: [Overview of creating apps in PowerApps](maker/index.md).

To create an app, you start with [web.powerapps.com](https://web.powerapps.com).

- **PowerApps Studio** is the app designer used for building canvas apps. The app designer makes creating apps feel more like building a slide deck in Microsoft PowerPoint. More information: [Generate an app from data]  

- **App designer for model-driven apps** lets define the sitemap and add components to build a model-driven app. More information: [Design model-driven apps using app designer](maker/model-driven-apps/design-custom-business-apps-using-app-designer.md)

## PowerApps for app users

You can run apps that you created, or that someone else created and shared with you, in browser or on mobile devices (phone or tablet). More information: [Find and run apps](user/index.md)

## PowerApps for admin

PowerApps admins can use the PowerApps admin center ([admin.powerapps.com](https://admin.powerapps.com)) to create and manage environments, users, roles, and data-loss prevention policies. More information: [Administer PowerApps](administrator/admin-guide.md)

Admins can also use Power platform admin center to manage environemnets, get real-time, self-help recommendations and get support for Dynamics 365, PowerApps, and Microsoft Flow, and view CDS for Apps analytics. More information: [Administer Power platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/admin-guide)

## PowerApps for developers

Developers are app makers who can write code to extend business app creation and customization by applying server-side logic, integrating with external data, build custom connetors, embed apps into your website experiences to create integrated solutions.
