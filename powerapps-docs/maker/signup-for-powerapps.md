# Sign up for a free license to try PowerApps
To create an app in PowerApps, you need one of several types of licenses that offer different levels of functionality. You already have a license for PowerApps if your organization has purchased any of several versions of Office 365 or Dynamics 365 for you, or your organization purchased PowerApps Plan 1 or Plan 2 licenses for you.

> [!NOTE]
> If you're an administrator, see [Purchase PowerApps for your organization](../administrator/signup-for-powerapps-admin.md) or [PowerApps in your organization Q&A](../administrator/signup-question-and-answer.md).

You can [learn more](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/pricing/) about which licenses include PowerApps and what they offer. You can also determine whether you have a license by selecting **Sign in** on the [PowerApps site](http://powerapps.microsoft.com).

   ![Sign-in option for PowerApps](./media/signup-for-powerapps/sign-in.png)

If you have no license or you want more functionality than what your current license offers, you can sign up for a free trial of PowerApps Plan 2. This license offers all PowerApps functionality but expires after 30 days.

## Upgrade an existing license 
You can sign up for a free trial by signing into PowerApps with an existing license and then trying any of these features:

* [Create and manage an instance](../administrator/signup-for-powerapps-admin.md) of the Common Data Service.
* [Model your data](./common-data-service/data-platform-intro.md) using the Common Data Service.
* [Create and manage environments](../administrator/environments-administration.md) from the PowerApps admin center.
* [Manage an on-premises data gateway](./canvas-apps/gateway-management.md) in PowerApps.  

If you try any of these features without a Plan 2 license, you'll be prompted to start your free trial. Just select **Start my trial**, and then consent to the terms of use in the dialog box that appears.

![Agree to terms of use](./media/signup-for-powerapps/trial-consent.png)

## Get a license from scratch
If you have no license for PowerApps, you can sign up for a trial license from the [PowerApps site](http://powerapps.microsoft.com).

* If you're using a browser on a phone, tap the menu icon in the upper-right corner, and then tap **Sign up free**.
* If you're using a browser on another type of device, select **Sign up free** in the upper-right corner.

    ![Sign up for free](./media/signup-for-powerapps/sign-up-browser.png)

Near the middle of the screen, select **Pricing**, and then select **Start free trial**.

![Start free trial](./media/signup-for-powerapps/start-free-trial.png)

In the dialog box that appears, type or paste your work or school email address, and then click or tap **Submit**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Consumer email services, telecommunication providers, government, and military addresses aren't supported, including:  
> 
> * outlook.com, hotmail.com, gmail.com, and so on  
> * .gov and .mil
>
> If you try to sign up with a personal email address, a message indicates that you must use a work or school email address.

![Type email address](./media/signup-for-powerapps/get-started-old.png)

If PowerApps recognizes your organization, you can sign in with your credentials for that organization (and skip the rest of these instructions).

![Sign in with work account](./media/signup-for-powerapps/we-know-you.png)

Otherwise, you're prompted to check your email. 

![Message to check email](./media/signup-for-powerapps/check-email.png)

In the email message, select the link to verify your email address, and (if prompted) provide more information.

When this dialog box appears, select **Start**, and then start to use [PowerApps](http://web.powerapps.com)!

![Click start](./media/signup-for-powerapps/almost-there.png)

> [!NOTE]
> If you need more time to evaluate PowerApps, you can request to extend your trial period.
