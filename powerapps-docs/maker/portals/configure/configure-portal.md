The Portal Management app allows you perform advanced configuration actions on your portal. The app is available after the database on Common Data Service is created successfully.

> [!NOTE]
> If your web browser has any extensions such as ad-blockers, you may see a script error when using the Portal Management app: `One of the scripts for this record has caused an error. For more details, download the log file.` The log file may reference `Webforms Form OnLoad : ReferenceError: Web resource method does not exist.` This error occurs for forms such as [Web pages](web-page.md), [Entity Forms](entity-forms.md), [Entity Lists](entity-lists.md), or [Web Form Steps](web-form-steps.md). To resolve this error, disable extensions such as ad-blockers in your browser. You may also use a different browser instead that doesn't have such extensions enabled.
