# View email records in a portal timeline

While working on a case or interacting with a customer, you might create an email to send to the customer. When you navigate to the Timeline in your support portal, you might not find the email because by default, email records are not displayed in the portal timeline. 

To view email records in a portal timeline, set the **CustomerSupport/DisplayAllUserActivitiesOnTimeline** site setting to true. You must also ensure that the filter criteria on the support portal are properly set to display email records.
