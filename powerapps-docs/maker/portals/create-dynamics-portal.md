# Create a Dynamics 365 portal

If you select an environment that contains model-driven apps in Dynamics 365, you can create the portals mentioned in [Portal templates](portal-templates.md).

1.	Sign in to [PowerApps](http://web.powerapps.com).

2.	Select **Create** on the left pane and enter **portal** in the **Search templates** field to display all Dynamics 365 Portal templates.

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Dynamics 365 Portal templates](media/dynamics-portals.png "Dynamics 365 Portal templates")  

3.	Select the required portal template.

4.	In the create portal window, enter a name for the portal and address for the website, and select a language from the drop-down list. When you're done, select **Create**. The creation process is same as described in the [Create a Common Data Service starter portal](create-portal.md) section.

> [!NOTE]
> - If you have purchased an older portal add-on, and want to provision a portal using the add-on, you must go to the **Dynamics 365 Administration Center** page. More information: [Provision a portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/dynamics365/customer-engagement/portals/provision-portal)
> - If you have provisioned a portal using the older portal add-on, you can still customize and manage it from [make.powerapps.com](https://make.powerapps.com).
> - Provisioning portals from [make.powerapps.com](https://make.powerapps.com) does not consume the older portal add-ons. Also, these portals are not listed under the **Applications** tab on the **Dynamics 365 Administration Center** page.
> - A Common Data Service starter portal cannot be created from the **Dynamics 365 Administration Center** page.
