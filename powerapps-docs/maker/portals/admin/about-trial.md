# About trial portals

When you create a portal, it is always created as a trial. A trial portal is useful for trying out its capabilities at no cost. Trial portals expire after 30 days. After expiration, the portal is put under the suspended state and is shutdown . After seven days of suspension, the trial portal is deleted.

As an administrator, you can convert a trial or a suspended portal to a production portal. While converting a trial portal to production, ensure that the environment is also a production environment. You canâ€™t convert a trial portal to production in a trial environment.

If you delete the environment in which a trial portal is created, the portal is also deleted. If a trial portal is not used for 15 days, it is put under the suspended state.
The first portal is free to be created in an environment in a tenant. If you need to create more than one portal, you must have 1 GB of unused storage space in the tenant.
