# About portal lifecycle

When you create a portal, it is always created as a trial. A trial portal is useful for trying out its capabilities at no cost. Trial portals expire after 30 days. After expiration, the portal is put under the suspended state and is shutdown . After seven days of suspension, the trial portal is deleted.

As an administrator, you can convert a trial or a suspended portal to a production portal. While converting a trial portal to production, ensure that the environment is also a production environment. You canâ€™t convert a trial portal to production in a trial environment. If you delete the environment in which a trial portal is created, the portal is also deleted.

The first portal is free to be created in an environment in a tenant. If you need to create more than one portal, you must have 1 GB of unused storage space in the tenant.

## Stages in portal lifecycle

### Trial portal

A portal is always created as a trial portal. You can convert it to production from PowerApps Portals admin center if you have the required licenses. For information on converting a trial portal to production, see [Convert a trial portal to production](#convert-a-trial-portal-to-production).

To convert a trial portal to production, the environment should have required add-ons for external users, or license for internal users. For more information on licensing, see [PowerApps and Microsoft Flow licensing FAQs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/powerapps-flow-licensing-faq) and [PowerApps Portals licensing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/powerapps-flow-licensing-faq#can-you-share-more-details-regarding-the-new-powerapps-portals-licensing).

### Suspended portal

You will continue to see notifications in PowerApps Portal admin center about your trial portal getting expired. Trial portals expire after 30 days. If you don't convert your portal to production within the trial period, the portal is shutdown and put under the suspended status. You will not be able to access your portal after its expiration.

However, the suspended portal can still be converted to production within seven days of suspension. 

### Deleted portal

If you fail to convert your portal to production within the seven days of suspension, the portal is deleted. The portal data is not deleted from the environment, but the space used by the portal in an environment will be released, and you can create a new portal.

## Convert a trial portal to production

You can convert a trial portal to production from the notifications displayed in PowerApps Portals admin center.
