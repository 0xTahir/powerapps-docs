# Edit CSS

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) allows you to control the formatting of your website. By default, bootstrap.min.css and theme.css files are available. You can edit the existing CSS files and upload new CSS files. When you upload a new CSS file, it will be available as a web file in the Portal Management app.

To open a CSS in code editor:

1.  [Edit the portal](manage-existing-portals.md#edit) to open it in PowerApps Portals Studio.  

2.  Select **Theme** ![Theme icon](media/theme-icon.png "Theme icon") from the toolbelt on the left side of the screen. The available themes are displayed.  

    > [!div class=mx-imgBorder]
    > ![Theme pane](media/theme-pane.png "Theme pane")  

3.  Select the required CSS to open it in the code editor.

4.  Edit the code and save the changes.

To upload a new CSS file:

2.  Select **Theme** ![Theme icon](media/theme-icon.png "Theme icon") from the toolbelt on the left side of the screen. The available themes are displayed.
