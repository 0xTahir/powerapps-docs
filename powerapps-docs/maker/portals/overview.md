# What is PowerApps Portals?

PowerApps makers can now create a powerful new type of experience: external-facing websites that allow users outside their organizations to sign in with a wide variety of identities, create and view data in Common Data Service, or even browse content anonymously. The full capabilities of [Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement Portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/portals/administer-manage-portal-dynamics-365), previously offered only as an add-on to Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement applications, are now available completely standalone inside of PowerApps.  

These capabilities feature a revamped end-to-end experience for makers to quickly create a website and customize it with pages, layout, and content. Makers can reuse page designs through templates, add forms and views to display key data from Common Data Service, and publish to users.

> [!NOTE]
> Since PowerPortals is in private preview, certain experiences might have known issues. These issues are mentioned in the [Known issues](known-issues.md) section later in this document.
