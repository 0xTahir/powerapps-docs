# Create custom business logic with flows

Defining and enforcing consistent business processes is one of the main reasons people use model-driven apps. Consistent processes help make sure people using a PowerApps app can focus on their work and not on remembering to perform a set of manual steps. Flows can be simple or complex and can change over time.  
  
Microsoft Flow includes several  types of processes, each designed for a different purpose:  

-   Automated flows. Create a flow that performs one or more tasks automatically after it's triggered by an event. More information: [Create a flow](/flow/get-started-logic-flow)
    
-   Button flows. Perform repetitive tasks simply by tapping a button on your mobile device. More information: [Introducing button flows](/flow/introduction-to-button-flows)
  
-   Scheduled flows. Create a flow that performs one or more tasks on a schedule such as once a day, on a specific date, or after a certain time. More information: [Run flows on a schedule](/flow/run-scheduled-tasks)
  
-   Business process flows.  Ensure that people enter data consistently and follow the same steps every time they work in an app by creating a business process flow. More information: [Business process flows overview](/flow/business-process-flows-overview)

-   Common Data Service for Apps. Dynamics 365 customer engagement customizers may be familar with the classic Common Data Service for Apps processes, which are workflows and actions. More information: [Use Workflow processes](/flow/workflow-processes) and [Actions overview](/flow/actions)
