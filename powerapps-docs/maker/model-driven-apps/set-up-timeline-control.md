## Customize field sections

In the timeline section, users see a card for each activity (based on the enabled activities). Each card displays certain fields in the collapsed and expanded mode. For example, see Task activity card in collapsed mode and expanded mode. 

Timeline card collapsed mode:

   > [!div class=mx-imgBorder] 
   > ![Timeline card in collapsed mode](media/timeline-card-collapsed-nocallout.png "Timeline card in collapsed mode")

Timeline card expanded mode:

   > [!div class=mx-imgBorder] 
   > ![Timeline card in expanded mode](media/timeline-card-expanded-nocallout.png "Timeline card in expanded mode")

The card form contains sections that you can configure to show the fields that matter to your business.

In the card, if you want to show any fields that are important to your business, you can customize the fields. Also, you can move the fields from one section to another section, such as from the Header section to the Detail section. To learn more, see [Customize the card form](#customize-the-card-form).

The card form has the following sections:

   | Section annotation | Section name | Display columns |
