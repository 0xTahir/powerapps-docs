Sharing an embedded canvas app

After you have added an embedded canvas app to a model-driven form you will need to take steps to ensure that all users that have access to the model-driven form also have access to the canvas app and the data that it uses.
-	Share your embedded canvas app with either Everyone in your organization, a security group or specific people.
-	Ensure that users have appropriate permissions for any Common Data Service entities that your app uses.
-	Ensure that users have appropriate permission for any other data sources that your app uses, such as SharePoint, OneDrive, etc. The steps to share vary based on the type of data you are sharing and are outside the scope of PowerApps.

Embedded canvas apps are solution aware. By default they are created in the same solution as the host model-driven form. To move the app from one environment to another you can export and import embedded canvas apps as a part of a solution just like any other component.
