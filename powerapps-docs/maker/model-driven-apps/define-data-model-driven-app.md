# Define data for your model-driven app

Data for your model-driven app is defined in [Common Data Service (CDS) for Apps](../common-data-service/data-platform-intro.md). 

You define your app data using the following components: *entity*, *field*, and *relationship*.

For detailed information about working with these components in CDS for Apps to define data for your model-driven app, see the following topics under CDS for Apps section:

|Component |Topic|
|-----|----|
|Entity| [Work with entities](../common-data-service/entity-overview.md)|
|Field| [Work with fields](../common-data-service/fields-overview.md)|
|Relationships| [Work with relationships](../common-data-service/relationships-overview.md)|
