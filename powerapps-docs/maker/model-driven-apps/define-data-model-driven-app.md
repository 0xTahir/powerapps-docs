# Define data for your model-driven app

Data for your model-driven app is defined in [Common Data Service (CDS) for Apps](../common-data-service/data-platform-intro.md). 

You define your app data using the following components in PowerApps: *entity*, *field*, *relationship*, and *option set field*. More information about these data components in a model-drven app: [Data in your app](model-driven-app-components.md#data)

For detailed information about working with these components in CDS for Apps to define data for your model-driven app, see the following topics under CDS for Apps section:

|Component |Topic|
|-----|----|
|Entity| TODO: Add link|
|Field| TODO: Add link|
|Relationships| TODO: Add link|
|Option set field| TODO: Add link|
