# Add, move, or delete components on a form  
[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Add, move, and remove fields using the form designer.

> [!NOTE]
> When adding or moving components using drag and drop be aware that the form preview is responsive andÂ may be rendering multiple section columns as stacked. To ensure that the component being added or moved is in the correct section column, drop or paste it anchored to another field or component that is already in that section column.

## Add components to a form
To add components to a form, use the **Components** pane. The **Components** pane also lets you search to help you quickly find components.

### Add components to a form using drag and drop

1. Open the form designer to create or edit a form. More information: [Create a form](create-and-edit-forms.md#create-a-form) or [Edit a form](create-and-edit-forms.md#edit-a-form)
2. In the command bar, select **Add component**, or in the left pane, select **Components**.
3. In the **Components** pane, search or scroll to find the component that you want to add.
4. In the **Components** pane, select a component and drag it onto the form preview. As you drag the component on the form preview, you will see drop targets where you can add the component. 
5. Drop the component in the location you want. Note the following: 
    - Components can be dropped before or after any existing component or field.
    - Components can also be dropped in the empty area within a section. In this case the component will be added in an available space so as to evenly distribute fields and components across the section columns.
    - Hovering over a tab header when dragging a component changes the currently selected tab, allowing you to add the component to a different tab.   
6. Repeat steps 3-5 above if you want to add more components.
7. In the command bar, select **Save** to save the form, or select **Publish** if you want to save and make your changes visible to users. 

### Add components to a form using selection 

1. Open the form designer to create or edit a form. More information: [Create a form](create-and-edit-forms.md#create-a-form) or [Edit a form](create-and-edit-forms.md#edit-a-form)
2. In the form preview, select another existing component or field or section. Note the following:
    - When you select an existing component or field, the new component is added after the existing commponent or field. 
    - When you select a section, the new component is added in an available space so as to evenly distribute components and fields across the section columns. 
3. In the command bar, select **Add components**, or in the left pane, select **Components**.
4. In the **Components** pane, search or scroll to find the component you want to add.
5. In the **Components** pane, select a component to add it to the form. Alternatively, select **...** next to the field you want, and then select **Add to selected section**. 
6. Repeat steps 2-5 above if you want to add more fields.
7. In the command bar, select **Save** to save the form, or select **Publish** if you want to save and make your changes visible to users. 

## Move components on a form

### Move commponents on a form using drag and drop

1. Open the form designer to create or edit a form. More information: [Create a form](create-and-edit-forms.md#create-a-form) or [Edit a form](create-and-edit-forms.md#edit-a-form)
2. In the form preview, select the component that you want to move and initiate the drag action. As you drag the component on the form preview, you will see drop targets where you can move the component to. 
3. Drop the component in the location you want. Note the following: 
    - Components can be dropped before or after any existing component or field.
    - Components can also be dropped in the empty area within a section. In this case the component will be added in an available space so as to evenly distribute components and fields across the section columns.
    - Hovering over a tab header when dragging a component changes the currently selected tab, allowing you to add the component to a different tab.   
4. Repeat steps 2-3 above if you want to move more components.
5. In the command bar, select **Save** to save the form, or select **Publish** if you want to save and make your changes visible to users. 

    > [!NOTE]
    >   Moving components in the header and footer using drag and drop is not yet supported. 

### Move components on a form using cut and paste

1. Open the form designer to create or edit a form. More information: [Create a form](create-and-edit-forms.md#create-a-form) or [Edit a form](create-and-edit-forms.md#edit-a-form)
2. In the form preview, select the component that you want to move.
3. In the command bar, select **Cut**.
4. In the form preview, select another existing component, field or section. You can also switch to a different tab if needed.
5. In the command bar, select **Paste** or select the chevron, and then select **Paste before**. Note the following:
    - When you select **Paste**, the component being moved is pasted after the existing component or field. 
    - When you select **Paste before**, the component being moved is pasted before the existing component or field.
    - When you select a section, the component being moved is added in an available space so as to evenly distribute components and fields across the section columns. The **Paste before** action is not applicable and therefore not available in this case.
6. Repeat steps 2-5 above if you want to move more components.
7. In the command bar, select **Save** to save the form, or select **Publish** if you want to save and make your changes visible to users. 

## Delete components on a form
1. Open the form designer to create or edit a form. More information: [Create a form](create-and-edit-forms.md#create-a-form) or [Edit a form](create-and-edit-forms.md#edit-a-form)
2. In the form preview, select the component that you want to delete from the form. 
3. In the command bar, select **Delete**. 
4. Repeat steps 2-3 above if you want to delete more components.
5. In the command bar, select **Save** to save the form, or select **Publish** if you want to save and make your changes visible to users. 

     > [!NOTE]
     >   -  If you delete a component by mistake, in the command bar, select **Undo** to revert the form to its previous state. 
     >   -  You can't delete a component that is locked or is using a required field that is not present anywhere else on the form.
