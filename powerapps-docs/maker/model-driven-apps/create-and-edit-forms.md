# Create and edit forms using the form designer 
Use the new form designer to create and design forms for model-driven apps.

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is currently in preview. <br />
> [!INCLUDE [cc-preview-features-definition](../../includes/cc-preview-features-definition.md)]
>  The new model-driven form designer currently only supports creating and editing main forms. To create and edit other form types, see [Create a model-driven app quick view form to view information about a related entity](create-edit-quick-view-forms.md) and [Create or edit model-driven app quick create forms for a streamlined data entry experience](create-edit-quick-create-forms.md). 

## Create a form 
1. Sign in to PowerApps. 
2. On the PowerApps Home page, in the navigation menu on the left, select Data and then select Entities. 
3. Select an entity, such as the Account entity. 
4. Select the Forms sub-list. 
5. In the command-bar, select Add form and then select Main form.     
    The contents of the new form will be jumpstarted using the existing Main form. If multiple Main forms exist, the form at the top of the list in the form order will be selected. 
6. To save your form, select **Save** or select **Publish** if you want the changes visible to end-users. The **Publish** command automatically saves any changes you have made to the form. 

## Edit a form 
1. Sign in to PowerApps. 
2. On the PowerApps Home page, in the navigation menu on the left, select Data and then select Entities. 
3. Select an entity, such as the Account entity. 
4. Select the Forms sub-list. 
5. Select the Main form that you want to edit and then in the command bar, select Edit form (preview). This will open the new model-driven form designer and load your form for editing. 
   An alternate option is to select the ellipsis next to the form you want to edit and then in the menu, select Edit form (preview). 
6. When you are ready to save your form, in the command bar, select Save or select Publish (if you want the changes to be visible to end-users). 
Â· In the new form designer Publish automatically saves any changes you have made to the form.
