# Create or edit forms using the form designer 
[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Use the new form designer to create or edit forms for model-driven apps. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The new model-driven form designer does not currently support editing card forms. More information: [Form types](types-forms.md)

## Create a form 
1. Sign in to [PowerApps](https://web.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc). 
2. On the left navigation pane, expand **Data**, and then select **Entities**. 
3. Select an entity, such as the account entity, and then select the **Forms** tab. 
4. Select **Add form**, and then select one of the following
    - **Main form (preview)**  
    The contents of the new form are filled using the existing main form definition. If multiple main forms exist, the form at the top of the list in the form order is used to fill the new form. 
    - **Quick create form (preview)**
    - **Quick view form (preview)**
5. When you are done making changes to the form, select **Save** to save the form, or select **Publish** if you want to save and make your changes visible to app users.  

## Edit a form 
1. Sign in to [PowerApps](https://web.powerapps.com/?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc). 
2. On the left navigation pane, expand **Data**, and then select **Entities**. 
3. Select an entity, such as the account entity, and then select the **Forms** tab.
4. Select the form name that you want to edit.  
    - You can also select the row for a form, and then in the command bar, select **Edit form (preview)**
    - Another alternative is to select **...** next to the form name, and then in the menu, select **Edit form (preview)**. 
5. When you are done making changes to the form, select **Save** to save the form, or select **Publish** if you want to save and make your changes visible to app users.
