# Add, configure, move, or delete fields on a form  
Add, configure, move, or delete fields using the form designer.

> [!NOTE]
> When adding or moving fields using drag and drop be aware that the form preview is responsive andÂ may be rendering multiple section columns as stacked. To ensure that the field being added or moved is in the correct section column, drop or paste it anchored to another field that is already in that section column.

## Add fields to a form
To add fields to a form, use the **Fields** pane. The **Fields** pane lets you search and filter to help you quickly find fields. It also includes the option to show only unused fields.

### Add fields to a form using drag and drop

1. Open the form designer to create or edit a form. More information: [Create a form](create-and-edit-forms.md#create-a-form) or [Edit a form](create-and-edit-forms.md#edit-a-form)
2. In the command bar, select **Add field**, or in the left pane, select **Fields**.  The **Fields** pane is open by default when the form designer is opened. 
3. In the **Fields** pane, search, filter, or scroll to find the field you want to add. If you can't find a field, it might already be on the form. Clear **Show only unused fields** to view all fields, including those already added to the form. 
4. In the **Fields** pane, select a field and drag it onto the form preview. As you drag the field on the form preview, you will see drop targets where you can add the field. 
5. Drop the field in the location you want. Note the following: 
    - Fields can be dropped before or after any existing field or component.
    - Fields can also be dropped in the empty area within a section. In this case the field will be added in an available space so as to evenly distribute fields and components across the section columns.
    - Hovering over a tab header when dragging a field changes the currently selected tab, allowing you to add the field to a different tab.   
6. Repeat steps 3-5 above if you want to add more fields.
7. In the command bar, select **Save** to save the form, or select **Publish** if you want to save and make your changes visible to users. 

### Add fields to a form using selection 

1. Open the form designer to create or edit a form. More information: [Create a form](create-and-edit-forms.md#create-a-form) or [Edit a form](create-and-edit-forms.md#edit-a-form)
2. In the form preview, select another existing field or section. Note the following:
    - When you select an existing field, the new field is added after the existing field. 
    - When you select a section, the new field is added in an available space so as to evenly distribute fields across the section columns. 
3. In the command bar, select **Add field**, or in the left pane, select **Fields**. The **Fields** pane is open by default when the form designer is opened. 
4. In the **Fields** pane, search, filter, or scroll to find the field you want to add. If you can't find a field, it might already be on the form. Clear **Show only unused fields** to view all fields, including those already added to the form. 
5. In the **Fields** pane, select a field to add it to the form. Alternatively, select **...** next to the field you want, and then select **Add to selected section**. 
6. Repeat steps 2-5 above if you want to add more fields.
7. In the command bar, select **Save** to save the form, or select **Publish** if you want to save and make your changes visible to users.

|**Display options** | **Lock field** |  Lock this field to keep it from being removed. |
|**Display options** | **Hide field** | When selected, field is hidden by default and can be shown using code. |

|**Formatting** | **Field width** |  When the section containing the fields has more than one column you can set the field to occupy up to the number of columns that the section has. |

| **Display options** | **Entity** |  The related entity that the lookup field connects to. |
| **Display options** | **Default view** |  The view of the entity selected in the **Entity** property that will be used to get and display the list of records that end-users can select in the lookup drop down. |

| **Display options** | **Show all views** |  When selected, end-users will be able to change from the **Default view** to all other views of the entity selected in the **Entity** property. <br /><br />This property is only available when **Allow users to change view** is selected. |
| **Display options** | **Selected views** |  A list of views of the entity selected in the **Entity** property that end-users will be able to change to from the **Default view**. <br /><br />This property is only available when **Allow users to change view** is selected and **Show all views** is unselected. |
