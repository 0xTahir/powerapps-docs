# Quickstart: Run a model-driven app on a mobile device

The apps you build are designed to run in a web browser across a variety of devices. How you start a model-driven app on a mobile device is really no different than starting the app on a PC. However, how your model-driven app looks and responds on a particular device depends on the client type the app is based on. There are two types of model-driven app clients. 

- Unified Interface: This client type provides key accessibility and responsive design benefits and has a similar interface across PC, Mac, and popular mobile devices. For most situations and especially for running on mobile devices, we recommend you create apps using the Unified Interface client type.
- Web: This app type appears and functions similar to the classic Dynamics 365 web browser client.

## Prerequisites

If you haven’t already, share the app and the app URL. Learn more: [Preview feature: Share a model-driven app with PowerApps](share-model-driven-app.md)

## Run a model-driven app
1.	Enter the app URL in your device’s web browser, tap ENTER, and then if prompted, sign-in to the app using your credentials. 
2.	If your account is associated with more than one app, a list of available apps appears. Select the app you want to run. 
3.	The app appears on your mobile device, such as a phone.
