# Properties available in the form designer

Located on the right-pane of the model-driven form designer, the always available property pane lets you quickly view and update the properties of any selected element.

## Form properties


|Name  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**Title**     | Enter a name that will be meaningful to people. This name will be shown to people when they use the form. If they can use multiple forms configured for the entity they will use this name to differentiate between available forms. <br /> This property is required.        |
|**Description**     |  Enter a description that explains how this form is different from other main forms. This description is only shown in the list of forms for an entity in the solution explorer.        |
|**Max Width**     | Set a maximum width (in pixels) to limit the width of the form. The default value is 1900. <br /> This property is required.       |
|**Show image**      | Show the entityâ€™s **Primary Image** if it has one set. This setting will enable showing the image field in the header of this form. <br /> See Enable or disable entity options for more information about entity options.         |
