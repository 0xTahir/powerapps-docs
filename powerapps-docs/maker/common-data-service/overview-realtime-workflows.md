# Classic Common Data Service realtime workflows 

Workflows automate business processes without a user interface. People usually use workflow processes to initiate automation that doesnâ€™t require any user interaction.

There are two types of workflows:
1. Background workflows. See the [Power Automate](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-automate/workflow-processes) documentation for more details about realtime workflows.
1. Realtime workflows. 

## Realtime workflows

To create realtime workflows, you must *uncheck* the **Run this workflow in the background (recommended)** checkbox, as displayed in the following image.

See other topics here in the Power Apps documentation to learn more about realtime workflows.
