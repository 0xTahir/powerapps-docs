# Understanding licence requirements for Premium entities

Common Data Service for Apps allows you to securely store and manage data that's used in apps you've developed or apps from Microsoft and app providers. Data within CDS for Apps is stored within a set of standard and custom entities. An entity is a set of fields used to store data similarly to a table within a database. After your data is stored you can use Microsoft PowerApps to build rich applications using your data:

* Leverage existing standard entities or create custom entities to support your scenario and application.
* Create PowerApps and Flows directly against CDS for Apps.
* Add custom fields, and relationships to standard entities where additional information is needed.
* Create calculated and roll up fields to your entities to provide consistent calculations across apps and analytics.
* Define business rules to ensure data quality within entities, regardless of the which app is accessing or editing your data.
* Create workflows and leverage integration with Microsoft Flow to drive additional actions and business processes against your data.
* Incorporate standard and custom entities into an app that you're developing as easily as you would with data in other sources.
* Connect to your data from Microsoft Excel using CDS for Apps productivity add-ins.
* Easily import and synchronize your data using Power Query.
* Secure your data within your organization using role-based security against standard and custom entities.
* Provide global support for your data and applications by leveraging translation of entity and field names in your user's language.

Each entity contains a set of records that users can create, read, update, and delete depending on their permissions. You can create relationships between entities so that you can look up information in one entity based on a record in another entity. For example, you could create a custom entity to track events which a customer had attended. By adding the Customer to your custom entity as a lookup field, you establish a relationship between the two entities which can be leveraged in your app and in reporting.

For information on purchasing a plan for using CDS for Apps, see [Pricing info](../../administrator/pricing-billing-skus.md).
