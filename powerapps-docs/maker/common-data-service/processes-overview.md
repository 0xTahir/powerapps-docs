# Processes overview

Consistent processes help make sure people using your app can focus on their work and not on remembering to perform a set of manual steps. Processes can be simple or complex and can change over time. 
PowerApps includes several types of processes, each designed for a different purpose: 
- **Business process flow**. Use when you want staff to move through the same stages and follow the same steps.
- **Mobile task flow**. This is a type of business process flow that is used for the Dynamics 365 for phones or Dynamics 365 for tablets apps.
- **Workflow**. Use to automate business processes behind the scenes. Workflows are typically initiated by system events so the user doesn't need to be aware that they are running.
- **Action**. Use when you want to automate a series of commands in the system. Actions are typically of interest to developers who want to create apps that interact with a process.
