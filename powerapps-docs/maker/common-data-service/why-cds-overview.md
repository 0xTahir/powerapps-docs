# Why choose Common Data Service?

Data is at the center of everything a business does today and powers the
insights that can drive what it should do tomorrow. To thrive and grow,
businesses need to capture, analyze, predict, present, and report data and do
all of this with a high level of agility.

Building out the data infrastructure to enable business insight can be both time consuming
and expensive. The data originates from a variety of devices, applications, systems, services, and SaaS. These large and growing number of sources often consist of multiple data technologies that store different types of data, expose different APIs, and use a mixture of security models. The developers needed to create these technologies can be both hard to find and expensive. Developers often must have a deep understanding of how to deploy, configure, manage, and integrate these different data technologies.

Common Data Service addresses these concerns with an easy to use, easy to manage, compliant, secure, scalable, and globally available SaaS data service. Common Data Service empowers organizations to work with any type of data, any type of app, and use the data within it to gain insights and drive business action.

As part of the Power Platform, Common Data Service requires no or little code to be written,
enabling it to easily be used by everyone from knowledge workers to professional developers.

Built on Microsoft Azure, organizations choosing Common Data Service can be confident that it's
globally available, compliant, scalable, and secure.

## Work with any type of data
--------------------------

Common Data Service is designed to work with any type of data and incorporates all the major
categories of data technologies that your organization needs – relational, non-relational, file, image, search, and data lake.

Common Data Service includes a set of visual designers to create, edit, and interact with data. This makes it easy to quickly define the entities, relationships, business rules, forms, and workflows, that represent your business.

With the easy to configure integration features built into Common Data Service, deep integration
with Microsoft’s clouds, such as Dynamics, Office, and Azure, plus access to over  connectors in Power Automate and Logic Apps, Common Data Service can connect to the devices, apps, systems, services, and popular SaaS offerings that contain the data for your business.

As a result, a wide range of enterprise integration scenarios - from retrieving
data sent in a spreadsheet as an email attachment to emerging scenarios like
using Common Data Service data in a blockchain network - can be achieved with ease and with
little to no code required. Integration efforts that previously were measured in
days and weeks can now often be measured in hours and minutes.

In addition to providing the ability to create data in Common Data Service or import it from other systems, Common Data Service also supports virtual entities. Virtual entities provide the ability to map data in an external data source so that it appears to be in Common Data Service. This enables Common Data Service to execute real-time data operations against the external data source. More information: [Work with any data](why-cds-work-with-data.md)

## Work with any type of app

When an organization wants to create a new application, additional
productivity gains can be had by using Common Data Service with Power Apps. Power Apps understands the rich metadata included in Common Data Service and utilizes it in multiple ways
to help you rapidly build great looking apps that are secure, scalable
and that can be delivered available across desktop, web, mobile, and Microsoft Teams.

Organizations building mobile applications with Power Apps can quickly develop apps for
iOS and Android. You can also take advantage of Common Data Service's mobile offline
functionality, which enables applications to collect, query, and interact with data when offline.

For organizations that want to integrate Common Data Service data into existing applications or
write new apps using custom code, Common Data Service provides a powerful REST-based API, a
developer SDK, and a growing list of samples for common scenarios.

Common Data Service can also be used in bot-based applications that deliver intuitive,
interactive dialogues with employees, partners, and customers. Whether building a
bot that is embedded within Power Apps or custom code, bots can be built quickly
using Power Virtual Agents and powered by Common Data Service data.

The goal of Common Data Service working with any app means it should also work with the tools
that knowledge workers and professional developers use as well. To help them be
even more productive, Common Data Service is integrated into popular tools such as Excel,
Outlook, Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement apps, Power BI Desktop, Power Query, Azure Data Factory, Data
Export Service, and SQL Server Management Studio. More information: [Work with any type of app](why-cds-any-type-app.md)

## Analytics and Reporting

Data in Common Data Service can be used to gain insights and drive business action using analytics and reporting. It also includes a variety of ways to deliver data and insight to key decision makers.

![Analytics and reporting features with Common Data Service](media/analytics-and-reporting.png)

Common Data Service includes the ability to create lightweight charts and paginated reports. Common Data Service data can also be used with Power BI to create rich, interactive reports and dashboards.

For organizations that are interested in employing AI to analyze their data,  AI Builder can enable everyone in the organization—regardless of their technical expertise—the ability to add AI capabilities to the business process flows they create and use. Delivered as part of the Power Platform, AI Builder includes six
pre-built AI models that can be used in Power Automate and Power Apps and to evaluate data within Common Data Service.

To support advanced analytics and machine learning, Common Data Service includes a managed data lake. Data within the lake can be used to run Power BI reporting, machine learning, data warehousing, and other downstream data processing.

![Common Data Service with Azure services](media/ai-builder-and-cds.png)

One of the benefits of the data being in Azure Data Lake is that organizations can leverage Azure Synapse Analytics. This service can deliver added productivity by bringing together enterprise data warehousing, data exploration, code-free data orchestration, deeply integrated Apache Spark and SQL engines,
and integrated AI and BI.

## Security

Common Data Service uses Azure Active Directory identity and access management mechanisms to help ensure that only authorized users can access the environment, data, and reports.

Common Data Service uses role-based security to group together a collection of privileges. These security roles can be associated directly to users, or they can be associated with Common Data Service teams and business units.

In Common Data Service, individual records can be shared on a one-by-one basis with another user. As record-level control of access is not adequate for some business scenarios, Common Data Service has a field-level security feature to allow more granular control of security at the field level.

Common Data Service also includes two security models that can be used for hierarchies, the *manager* hierarchy and the *position* hierarchy. With the manager hierarchy, a manager must be within the same business unit as the report, or in the parent business unit of the report’s business unit, to have access to the report’s data. The position hierarchy allows data access across business units. 

As Common Data Service is built on Microsoft Azure, it benefits from the Azure platform’s powerful security technologies. Encryption of data, at rest and in transit, preserves confidentiality.

Common Data Service is governed by the [Microsoft Online Service Terms](https://www.microsoftvolumelicensing.com/DocumentSearch.aspx?Mode=3&DocumentTypeId=31) and the [Microsoft Online Services Privacy Statement](https://www.microsoft.com/privacystatement/OnlineServices/Default.aspx).

More information about the security concepts in Common Data Service can be found in this article: 
[Security concepts in Common Data Service](/power-platform/admin/wp-security-cds).

Compliance
----------

Compliance is a key concern for organizations, and Microsoft regularly engages
with dozens of regulators around the world. Organizations can be assured that
the data placed in Common Data Service is held in accordance with stringent
industry safeguards. The Common Data Service complies with the numerous
standards and compliance is verified by third-party audits and certifications.

The list of currently supported standards can be found
[here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/trust-center/compliance/compliance-overview).

## Availability and Scalability

Common Data Service is designed to meet enterprise-level scalability needs and offers a service level agreement of 99.9 uptime.

To help ensure service levels, availability and quality, there are entitlement limits to the number of requests users can make each day, which are governed by licenses. There are also service protection limits put in place against malicious behavior that would otherwise disrupt service for all customers.

### Microsoft Power Platform Requests

Microsoft Power Platform requests consist of actions, which a user makes across various products.

At a high level, below is what constitute an API call:

- **Connectors**: All API requests to connectors from Power Apps or Power Automate.

- **Microsoft Power Automate**: All Power Automate step actions.

- **Common Data Service**: All create, update, delete (CRUD) operations, as well as special operations like "share" or "assign." These can be from any client or application and using any endpoint SOAP or REST. These include but are not limited to plug-ins, async workflows, and custom controls making the above-mentioned operations.

The specific number of allowed APIs that a user can make in a 24-hour period is governed by the user's license.

### Entitlement limits

Entitlement limits represent the number of requests users are entitled to make each day. The allocated limit depends on the type of license assigned to each user.

For information about these entitlement limits, see [Microsoft Power Platform requests allocations based on licenses](/power-platform/adminapi-request-limits-allocations#microsoft-power-platform-requests-allocations-based-on-licenses).

For information about viewing and allocating capacity add-ons, see [Capacity add-ons](/power-platform/admin/capacity-add-on).

For information about purchasing individual capacity add-ons, see [Power Apps and Power Automate Licensing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2085130).

### Service protection limits

Service protection limits exist to protect the health of the service for everyone. These limits provide a level of protection against random and unexpected surges in request volumes that threaten the availability and
performance characteristics of the Common Data Service platform.

The service limits the number of concurrent connections per user account, the number of API requests per connection, and the amount of execution time that can be used for each connection. These are evaluated within a five-minute sliding window. When one of these limits is exceeded, an exception is returned by the platform.

Service limits are not expected to impact normal usage of the Common Data Service.

Information on *current* service protection limits for each service:

- [Common Data Service API request limits](/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/api-limits): Applicable to Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement apps, such as Dynamics 365 Sales and Dynamics 365 Customer Service, as well as Power Apps and Power Automate connecting to Common Data Service.

- [Microsoft Power Automate limits](/flow/limits-and-config#looping-and-debatching-limits): Applicable for Power Automate. 

- [Limits in connectors](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/): Applicable for Power Automate and Power Apps.

Additional information about how service protection limits are enforced can be found in this article: 
[Service Protection API Limits](/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/api-limits).

### Capacity add-ons

The specific number of allowed Microsoft Power Platform requests that a user can make in a 24-hour period is governed by a user’s license. For scenarios where additional capacity is required, a Power Apps and Power Automate capacity add-on allows customers to purchase additional requests.

Each capacity add-on provides an additional 10,000 requests every 24 hours, which can be assigned to any user. Multiple capacity add-ons can also be assigned to the same user.

Common Data Service has entitlement limits that will evaluate the number of requests made against the number allowed by their current license.

## Backups

Common Data Service provides two types of backups - automatic backups, referred to as *system* backups, and *manual* backups.

### System backups
System backups back up all environments. They take place automatically and continuously. The underlying technology used is Azure SQL Database. For more information about Azure SQL automated backups, see [Automated backups](/azure/sql-database/sql-database-automated-backups). 

System backups for production environments that have been created with a database and have one or more Dynamics 365 applications installed are retained up to 28 days. System backups for production environments, which do not have Dynamics 365 applications deployed in them are retained for seven days. System backups for sandbox environments are retained for seven days.

### Manual backups 
Manual backups are user initiated, typically done before making a significant customization change or applying a version update.

Both sandbox and production environments can be manually backed up. Sandbox backups are retained for up to seven days. Manual backups for production environments that have been created with a database and have one or more Dynamics 365 applications installed are retained up to 28 days. Manual backups for production environments, which do not have Dynamics 365 applications deployed in them will be retained
for seven days.

There is no limit to the number of manual backups that can be made and manual backups do not count against storage limits.

> [!NOTE]
> Both system and manual backups may only be restored to an environment to the same region in which it was backed up.

More information: [Back up and restore environments](/power-platform/admin/backup-restore-environments)

## Datacenter regions

As many organizations do business globally, their data needs are also global in nature. With Common Data Service deployed and supported in regions across the world, organizations can have confidence that Common Data Service is available when and where they need it.

The current list of data center regions can be found in this article: [Datacenter regions](/power-platform/admin/new-datacenter-regions).
