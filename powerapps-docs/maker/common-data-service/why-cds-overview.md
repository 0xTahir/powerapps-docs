# Why choose Common Data Service?

Data is at the center of everything a business does today and powers the
insights that can drive what it should do tomorrow. To thrive and grow,
businesses need to capture, analyze, predict, present, and report data and do
all of this with a high level of agility.

Building out the data infrastructure to enable this can be both time consuming
and expensive as the data originates from a variety of devices, applications,
systems, services, and SaaS. These large and growing number of sources often
consist of multiple data technologies that store different types of data,
expose different APIs, and can use a mixture of security models. The developers
needed to create these technologies can be both hard to find and expensive. Developers often must have a deep
understanding of how to deploy, configure, manage, and integrate these different
data technologies.

Common Data Service addresses these concerns with an easy to use, easy
to manage, compliant, secure, scalable, and globally available SaaS data service.
Common Data Service empowers organizations to work with any type of data,
any type of app, and use the data within it to gain insights and drive business
action.

As part of the Power Platform, Common Data Service requires no or little code to be written,
enabling it to easily be used by everyone from knowledge workers to professional
developers.

Built on Microsoft Azure, organizations choosing Common Data Service can be confident that it's
globally available, compliant, scalable, and secure.

## Work with any type of data
--------------------------

Common Data Service is designed to work with any type of data and incorporates all the major
categories of data technologies that your organization needs – relational,
non-relational, file, image, search, and data lake.

Common Data Service includes a set of visual designers to create, edit, and interact with data. This makes it easy to quickly define the entities, relationships, business rules, forms, and workflows, that represent your business.

With the easy to configure integration features built into Common Data Service, deep integration
with Microsoft’s clouds, such as Dynamics, Office, and Azure, plus access to over 200
connectors in Power Automate and Logic Apps, Common Data Service can connect to the devices,
apps, systems, services, and popular SaaS offerings that contain the data for
your business.

As a result, a wide range of enterprise integration scenarios - from retrieving
data sent in a spreadsheet as an email attachment to emerging scenarios like
using Common Data Service data in a blockchain network - can be achieved with ease and with
little to no code required. Integration efforts that previously were measured in
days and weeks can now often be measured in minutes and hours.

In addition to providing the ability to create data in Common Data Service or import it from
other systems, Common Data Service also supports virtual entities. Virtual entities provide the ability to
map data in an external data source so that it appears to be in Common Data Service and enables using Common Data Service to execute real time data operations against the external data source.

## Work with any type of app

When an organization wants to create a new application, additional
productivity gains can be had by using Common Data Service with Power Apps. Power Apps
understands the rich metadata included in Common Data Service and utilize it in multiple ways
to help you rapidly build great looking apps that are secure, scalable
and that can be delivered available across desktop, web, mobile, and Microsoft Teams.

Organizations building mobile applications with Power Apps can quickly develop apps for
iOS and Android. You can also take advantage of Common Data Service's mobile offline
functionality, which enables applications to collect, query, and interact with data when offline.

For organizations that want to integrate Common Data Service data into existing applications or
write new apps using custom code, Common Data Service provides a powerful REST based API, a
developer SDK, and a growing list of samples for common scenarios.

Common Data Service can also be used in bot-based applications that deliver intuitive,
interactive dialogues with employees, partners, and customers. Whether building a
bot that is embedded within Power Apps or custom code, bots can be built quickly
using Power Virtual Agents and powered by Common Data Service data.

The goal of Common Data Service working with any app means it should also work with the tools
that knowledge workers and professional developers use as well. To help them be
even more productive, Common Data Service is integrated into popular tools such as Excel,
Outlook, Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement apps, Power BI Desktop, Power Query, Azure Data Factory, Data
Export Service, and SQL Server Management Studio.
