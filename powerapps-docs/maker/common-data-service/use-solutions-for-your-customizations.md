# Use the Common Data Services default solution  

All PowerApps environments include the following solutions.
-	Common Data Services default solution. This is a base solution that is available for makers to use as the default solution for an environment.
-	Default Solution. This is a legacy solution that contains all available solutions in an environment. 
-	Base Custom Controls Core. This solution includes a core set of controls. Controls are used in user interface elements, such as fields, lists, and views. 

Notice that if you have installed or imported other applications or solutions, additional solutions may be available in the solutions list.  

By default,  when you build or customize a model-driven app, you work with the Common Data Services default solution. You can open the Common Data Services default solution to view or edit the components that are contained in the solution. To do this, follow these steps.
 
1.  On the [PowerApps](https://web.powerapps.com) site, select **Model-driven** (lower left of the navigation pane).

2. On the left navigation pane select **Solutions**.
3. In the list of solutions, select **Common Data Services Default Solution**.
  
> [!TIP]
>  If you plan to export the applications your make, consider changing the solution publisher customization prefix. More information: [Solution publisher prefix](change-solution-publisher-prefix.md).
