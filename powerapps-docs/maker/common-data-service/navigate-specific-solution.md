# Navigate to a specific project

If your organization already has a specific project you should work in, this is how you can find it. To create a new project, see [Create your own project](create-solution.md).  
  
## Open a project  
  
1. Click on **Projects** from the left navigation to see a list of projects in your environment.
  
2. Double-click the project that you want to work in to open it.  
  
 When you’re in the project, you’ll see its components. More information: [Add Components](solutions-overview.md)  

 ## Next steps
[Monitor and manage workflow processes](/flow/monitor-manage-processes)
