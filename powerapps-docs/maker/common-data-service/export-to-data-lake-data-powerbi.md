# Analyze Common Data Service data in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 with Power BI

After exporting data from Common Data Service to Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2
with the export to data lake service, you can use Power BI to create business
reports and analytics. This can be useful for sales managers and sales associates to refine and build additional reports and dashboards in Power BI. 

This article shows you how to perform the following tasks: 

1.  Connect the Data Lake Storage Gen2 storage container containing the exported Common Data Service data to Power BI.

2.  Create a report in Power BI that graphs account owners and their respective total account revenue.

## Prerequisites
This section describes the prerequisites necessary to consume Athena data with Power BI using export to data lake.
-  **Power BI Desktop**. [Get it now](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/downloads/)

-  **Export to data lake:** This guide assumes that you have already exported Common Data Service data using the [Export to data lake service](export-to-data-lake.md).  In this example, account entity data is exported to the data lake and will generate a report using the account entity fields.
