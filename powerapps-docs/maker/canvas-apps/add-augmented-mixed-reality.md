# Add augmented reality controls to your app

You can add a number of augemented reality (AR) controls to your canvas app to support multiple 3D and mixed reality scenarios.

Add these controls [as you would for other controls](add-configure-controls.md).

## Prerequisites

- Learn how to [add and configure a control](add-configure-controls.md) in Power Apps.
- Follow the [qickstart guide](augmented-reality-quickstart.md) to learn how to start adding AR controls into existing or new, simple apps
- Explore [example AR apps](augmented-reality-example-apps.md) and see what sorts of scenarios AR controls can help solve
- Import existing 3D assets into .glb files that use the GL Transmission Format (glTF) with our [AR Import Tool](/dynamics365/mixed-reality/import-tool/)


## Scenarios

### Viewing 3D models in canvas apps

Users of your app may want to view existing 3D models. The 3D model viewer lets them pan, zoom, rotate, shear, whatever their whatevers when they whatever with their whatevering.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>If you have existing 3D models, ensure they are in the .glb file format. You can use our [AR Import Tool](/dynamics365/mixed-reality/import-tool/) to convert from a variety of industry 3D formats into .glb.

### Augmented reality fit and finish

You can use AR in your app to let users see how a particular item might fit within a specified space. To do that you need to use the following controls:

- Blah
- Blahblah
- Moreblahs

### Whatever other scenario

Describe what this scenario achieves, what the controls are that are needed.
