# Canvas app embedding SDK in PowerApps

[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Now more than ever, businesses and organizations have embraced the value of using data to drive outcomes. They need software that is driven by data and powered by AI and cognitive services to help them fundamentally re-imagine how they engage customers, empower employees, transform operations, and re-imagine products and services. There are three pillars for how organizations should approach transforming their business with a digital feedback loop: 

1. Buying off-the-shelf packaged applications is the fastest way for your customers to transform their business and gets them 80% of the results. 
2. No application is exactly what the customer needs, the next wave of results come from customizing those applications to fit your customers’ processes and industry. 
3. Sometimes there is no *app for that* and creating a custom app that perfectly fits into your customers workflows are required to get the benefits of the last mile of digital transformation.

PowerApps is high productivity, a low-code development platform that empowers app makers and enables anyone to build rich experiences. By embedding canvas apps in your application, you can quickly and easily transform your customers into makers. Your new makers can extend your applications from creating simple custom forms to adding feature rich screens and everything in between. They can connect to data, create business logic, and orchestrate workflows all from within your application. By enabling your customers to act as makers, your applications and services can finally cross that last mile and fit perfectly into your customers’ workflows making them even more valuable and indispensable. 

## Canonical scenarios

As you look to enable your customers to become makers, there are three different types of scenarios (which can be pursued simultaneously). 

1. Enabling makers to build standalone apps on your services 
2. Enabling makers to customize and extend your apps 
3. Enabling a maker extension ecosystem for your application 

To learn more about each individual scenario, you need to request access through the [insider program]() to access the full documentation.
