# Concurrent function in PowerApps
Evaluates multiple formulas concurrently with one another.

## Description
The **Concurrent** function evaluates multiple formulas at the same time.  Normally multiple formulas are evaluated by chaining them together with the [**;**](operators.md) (or [**;;**](operators.md)) operator which evaluates each sequentially in order.  The result of performing operations concurrently versus sequentially is the same; the only difference is the amount of time the user will need to wait.

Use **Concurrent** to improve performance when loading data in the [**OnStart**](../controls/control-screen.md) of your app.  Rather than waiting for each data call to finish before starting the next and incurring the network latency cost over and over, you can start the data calls at the same time and overlap the network latency.  Performing multiple data operations concurrently is often done by web browsers for greater performance.  

The order in which formulas within the **Concurrent** begin and end evaluation is unpredictable.  Formulas within the **Concurrent** should not contain dependencies on other formulas within the same **Concurrent** and the authoring environment will generate an error if this is attempted.  From within, it is safe to take dependencies on formulas outside the **Concurrent** as they will complete before the **Concurrent** begins.  It is also safe for formulas after the **Concurrent** to take dependencies on formulas within as they will all complete before the **Concurrent** finishes and moves on to the next formula in a chain (using the **;** or **;;** operator).  Watch out for subtle order dependencies if you are calling functions or service methods that have side effects.

You can chain formulas together with the **;** (or **;;**) operator within an argument to **Concurrent**.  For example **Concurrent( Set( a, 1 ); Set( b, a+1 ), Set( x, 2 ); Set( y, x+2 ) )** will evaluate **Set( a, 1 ); Set( b, a+1 )** concurrently with **Set( x, 2 ); Set( y, x+2 )**.  In this case, the dependencies within the formulas are fine since the set of **a** will happen before the set of **b** and the set of **x** before the set of **y**.   

The number of formulas that will actually be evaluated concurrently depends on the device or browser in which the app is running and may only be a handful.  **Concurrent** will use what capabilities are available and will not complete until all formulas have been evaluated.

With "Formula-level error management" enabled as an advanced setting then the first error encountered in argument order will be returned from **Concurrent**, otherwise *blank* will be returned.  If all formulas are successful, *true* is returned.  If one formula fails the rest of that formula will stop, but other formulas will continue evaluating.

**Concurrent** can only be used in [behavior formulas](../working-with-formulas-in-depth.md).

## Syntax
**Concurrent**( *Formula1*, *Formula2* [, ...] )

* *Formula(s)* â€“ Required. Formulas to evaluate concurrently.  At least two formulas must be supplied.

## Examples

#### Loading data faster

1. Create a new app.

2. Add four different data sources from the Common Data Service for apps, SQL Server, or SharePoint.  In this example, we are using four tables from the [sample Adventure Works database on SQL Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-get-started-portal).

2. Add a **[Button](../controls/control-button.md)** control, and set its **OnSelect** property to this formula:

	**ClearCollect( Product, '[SalesLT].[Product]' );<br>
	ClearCollect( Customer, '[SalesLT].[Customer]' );<br>
	ClearCollect( SalesOrderDetail, '[SalesLT].[SalesOrderDetail]' );<br> 
	ClearCollect( SalesOrderHeader, '[SalesLT].[SalesOrderHeader]' )**

3. Both [Microsoft Edge](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide/network) and [Google Chrome](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/network-performance/) offer developer tools to monitor network traffic while your app is running.  Turn this on in your browser.  You may want to also turn on network throttling to exaggerate the effects of this comparison.  

4. Press the button.  Watch the network traffic.  You will see four requests performed in series similar to this:

	![Time graph of four network requests, one starting after the last, covering the entire span of time](media/function-concurrent/chained-network.png)

5. Save and close the app.  As data is cached by PowerApps, hitting the button again will not necessarily cause four new requests.  Each time you want to test the performance again, you will need to close and reopen your app.  If you turned on network throttling, you may want to turn it off until you are ready for another test.

1. Add a second **[Button](../controls/control-button.md)** control, and set its **OnSelect** property to this formula:

	**Concurrent(<br> 
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ClearCollect( Product, '[SalesLT].[Product]' ),<br> 
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ClearCollect( Customer, '[SalesLT].[Customer]' ),<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ClearCollect( SalesOrderDetail, '[SalesLT].[SalesOrderDetail]' ),<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ClearCollect( SalesOrderHeader, '[SalesLT].[SalesOrderHeader]' )<br>
	)**

	Note that these are the same **ClearCollect** calls as with the first button, but they are wrapped in a Concurrent function and separated by commas.

2. Clear the network monitor in the browser.  If you were using network throttling before, turn it on again now.

3. Press the second button.   Watch the network traffic.  You will see four requests performed concurrently similar to this:

	![Time graph of four network requests, all four starting together, covering about half of the span of time](media/function-concurrent/concurrent-network.png)

	These two network graphs are on the same scale.  Using **Concurrent** the wall time required to perform these four operations is about half of what it was for the sequential chaining operator. 

5. Save and close the app.   

#### Race condition

1. Add a connection to the [Microsoft Translator](../connections/connection-microsoft-translator.md) service to your app.

2. Insert a [**Text Input**](../controls/control-text-input.md) control, and rename it **TextInput1** if it has a different name.

3. Insert a **Button** control and set its **OnSelect** property to this formula:

	**Set( StartTime, Value(Now()) );<br>
	RunInParallel(<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set(FRTrans, MicrosoftTranslator.Translate(TextInput1.Text,"fr")); Set(FRTransTime, Value(Now()) ),<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Set(DETrans, MicrosoftTranslator.Translate(TextInput1.Text,"de")); Set(DETransTime, Value(Now()) )<br>
	); <br>
	Collect( <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Results, <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Input: TextInput1.Text, <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French: FRTrans, FrenchTime: FRTransTime-StartTime,<br> 
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;German: DETrans, GermanTime: DETransTime-StartTime,<br> 
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FrenchFaster: FRTransTime < DETransTime <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br>
	)**

4. Insert a [**Date Table**](../controls/control-date-table.md) control and select the **Results** as the data source.  Select all fields to display.

6. Enter whatever phrase you like to see translated in the text input box.

7. Press the button multiple times to fill the table.  The times shown are in milliseconds.
  
	![Display of the data table containing results of translating the string "Hello World" to French and German.  Sometimes the French translation is faster than the German, and sometimes it is the other way around.](media/function-concurrent/race-condition.png) 

	You will see that in some cases the French translation takes less time than the German translation and vice versa.  Both begin execution at the same time but for a variety of reasons including network latency, server side processing, etc one will return before the other.  

	We would have a [race condition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition) if our app was dependent on which translation ended first.  Fortunately, the authoring studio will flag most timing dependencies for you.
