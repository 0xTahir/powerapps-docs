# Choices function in PowerApps
Returns a table of the possible values for a lookup column.

## Description
The **Choices** function returns a table of the possible values for a lookup column.  

Use the **Choices** function to provide a list of choices for your user to select from.  It is commonly used with the [**Combo box**](../controls/control-combo-box.md) control in edit forms.

For a lookup, the table returned by **Choices** is the same as the foreign table associated with the lookup.  Using **Choices** eliminates the need to add the foreign table as an additional data source.  All columns of the foreign table are returned by **Choices**.

Since **Choices** returns a table, you can use [**Filter**](function-filter-lookup.md), [**Sort**](function-sort.md), [**AddColumns**](function-table-shaping.md), and all the other table manipulation functions to filter, sort, and shape the table before using it. 

At this time, **Choicess** cannot be [delegated](../delegation-overview.md). If this poses a problem in your situation, add the foreign entity as a data source and use it directly.  

Unlike the [**ShowColumns**](function-table-shaping.md), [**Search**](function-filter-lookup.md), and other table functions that require column names to a string and enclosed in double quotes, this is not the case for **Choices**.  Provide the formula as if you were referencing the column directly.

Column references must be direct to the data source.  For example, if the data source is **Accounts** and the lookup is **SLA** then the column reference would be **Accounts.SLA**. The reference cannot pass through a function, variable, of control.  Furthering this example, if **Accounts** is fed to a **Gallery** control, then the SLA for the selected account can be referenced by the formula **Gallery.Selected.SLA**.  However, as this reference has passed through a control, it cannot be passed to the **Columns** function - **Accounts.SLA** must still be used.  

At this time, only SharePoint and the Common Data Service support lookup columns.

## Syntax
**Choices**( *column-reference* )

* *column-reference* â€“ Required.  A lookup column of a data source.  Do not enclose the column name in double quotes.  The reference must be directly to the column of the data source and not pass through a function or control.

## Examples

#### Choices for a lookup

1. Create a [Common Data Service database](../../../administrator/create-database.md) and check the box to "Include sample apps and data".  Many entities will be created including the **Accounts** entity:

	![A partial list of the fields from the Account entity in the Commmon Data Service, highlighting that "Primay Contact" is a lookup field](media/function-choices/entity-account.png)

	The **Accounts** entity has a **Primary Contact** column which is a lookup to the **Contacts** entity.  

	![A partial list of the fields from the Contact entity in the Commmon Data Service](media/function-choices/entity-contact.png)

	For each each Account, there is a Contact designated as the Primary Contact.  It is also possible that the Primary Contact is *blank*.
 
2. [Generate an app from the Common Data Service](../data-platform-create-app.md) using the **Accouns** entity.

3. Select the **EditForm1** control in the **EditScreen1** screen from the left hand Screens pane.

8. If it has not already been added, add the **Primary Contact** field to the form.  It will appear at the end of the list of fields in the form, which you can move up or down in the form.

9. Select the **Combo box** control within the card for **Primary Contact**.  View the **Items** property which will contain the formula:

	**Choices( Accounts.'Primary Contact' )**

	![A canvas screen with a form control.  The combo box control within the Primary Contact data card is selected showing the Items property with the formula Choices( Accounts.'Primary Contact' )](media/function-choices/accounts-primary-contact.png)

	Note that if the "Use column display names" is turned off in the app's advanced settings that this formula will appear as **Choices( Acccounts.primarycontactid )**.

10. To see what **Choices** is returning, inert a new screen.

11. Add a **Data table** control and set its **Items** property to the formula:

	**Choices( Accounts.'Primary Contact' )**

11. In the Data pane, select "First Name", "Last Name", or any other fields that you would like to view.

    Many entities, such as **Accounts**, are created.

    **Note**: Entity names are singular on web.powerapps.com and plural in PowerApps Studio.

	The **Accounts** entity has a **Primary Contact** column, which is a lookup to the **Contacts** entity.  

	![A partial list of the fields from the Contact entity in the Commmon Data Service](media/function-choices/entity-contact.png)

	For each account, a contact is designated as the primary contact, or the primary contact is *blank*.

2. [Generate an app](../data-platform-create-app.md) from the **Accounts** entity.

3. In the list of screens and controls near the left edge, scroll down until **EditScreen1** appears, and then select **EditForm1** just under it.

	![In the left navigation bar, select EditForm1 on EditScreen1](media/function-choices/select-editform.png)

4. On the **Properties** tab of the right pane, select **Accounts**.

	![Select Accounts to open the Data pane](media/function-choices/open-data-pane.png)

5. In the **Data** pane, scroll down to the list of fields.

	![Select Accounts to open the Data pane](media/function-choices/field-list.png)

6. Find the **Primary Contact** check box, and then select it if it's cleared.

7. (optional) Drag the **Primary Contact** field from the bottom to the top of the list of fields.

8. In the card for **Primary Contact**, select the **Combo box** control.

    The **Items** property of that control is set to one of two formulas based on the state of the **Use column display names** check box in advanced settings.

   - If the check box is selected, the property is set to this formula:<br>**Choices( Accounts.'Primary Contact' )**
   - If the check box is cleared, the property is set to this formula:<br>**Choices( Accounts.primarycontactid )**

9. On the **Home** tab, select **New screen**, and then select **Blank**.

10. On the **Insert** tab, select **Data table**.

11. Set the **Items** property of the **Data table** control to one of these formulas:

     - If the **Use column display names** check box in advanced settings is selected, use this formula:<br>**Choices( Accounts.'Primary Contact' )**
     - Otherwise, use this formula:<br>**Choices( Accounts.primarycontactid )**

12. Open the **Data** pane, and then select the check boxes for **firstname**, **lastname**, or any other field that you want to show.
