# Select function in PowerApps
Simulates a select action on a control, causing the **OnSelect** formula to be evaluated.

## Description
The **Select** function simulates a select action on a control as if the user had clicked or touched the control.  As a result, the **OnSelect** formula on the target control is evaluated.

Use **Select** to propagate a select action to a parent control.  Controls inserted into a **[Gallery](../controls/control-gallery.md)** control have a default **OnSelect** property set to **Select( Parent )**.  With this propagation in place, set the **OnSelect** of the gallery control to have mouse clicks anywhere in the gallery evaluate the same formula.  You can also have specialized buttons in your gallery that perform different actions by replacing **Select( Parent )** on just those controls with your own formula while having most of the gallery continue to propagate to the **OnSelect** of the gallery.  

**Select** queues the target **OnSelect** for later processing which may happen after the current formula has finished being evaluated.  **Select** does not cause the target **OnSelect** to evaluate immediately nor does it wait for it finish evaluation.  

Controls within a container control, such as a gallery or form, can only be used if the formula invoking the **Select** is on a control within the same container.  **Select** cannot be used across screens.

**Select** can only be used with controls that have an **OnSelect** property.  

**Select** can only be used in [behavior formulas](../working-with-formulas-in-depth.md).

A control cannot **Select** itself directly or indirectly through other controls.

## Syntax
**Select**( *Control* )

* *Control* â€“ Required.  The control to select on behalf of the user.  

## Examples

#### Basic usage

1. Insert a **[Button](../controls/control-button.md)** control, and rename it **Button1** if it has a different name.

2. Set this first button control's **OnSelect** property to this formula:

	**Notify( "Hello World" )**. 

2. Insert a second **Button** control on the same screen, and set its **OnSelect** property to:

	**Select( Button1 )**.

4. Press the second button.  You will see a notification across the top of your app.  This notification was generated by the **OnSelect** property of the first button control.

#### Gallery control

1. Insert a **[Gallery](../controls/control-gallery.md)** control.  Select the first template with image, text, and angle bracket.

2. Set the **OnSelect** property of the gallery to this formula:
 
	**Notify( "Gallery Selected" )**

3. Hold down the Alt key and click the background of the gallery, the image control, any of the test, or the angle bracket icon.  All clicks will flash the "Gallery Selected" banner at the top of the app.  
 
	Use the gallery's **OnSelect** for the default action to take when an item is selected in the gallery.

5. Set the **OnSelect** property of the image control to this formula:

	**Notify( "Image Selected", Success )**

6. Hold down the Alt key and again click the various elements of the gallery.  All of them continue to display "Gallery Selected" except for the image control which displays "Image Selected". 
 
	Use individual controls in the gallery to take different actions, independent of the gallery's default action.
