# Trace function in Power Apps Test Studio

Trace is an optional test expression that can be used to provide additional information in your test results from the **OnTestCaseComplete** event. Trace event messages, as well as any messages for both passed and failed assertions, are contained in a Traces table in the TestCaseResult record. The Traces table has two properties, Message and Timestamp. 

## Syntax

*Trace(message)*

- *Message* â€“ Required. A text value that creates a record in the Traces table in the TestCaseResult record.
