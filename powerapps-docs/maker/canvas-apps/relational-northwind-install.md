# Install Northwind Traders sample database and apps

Northwind Traders is a fictitious company that sells products to customers.  It is a good example of a relational database that combines Orders, Products, Customers, Suppliers, and many other aspects of a small business.  This sample appeared with the first versions of Microsoft Access and is still available as an Access template today.

We have moved this database to the Common Data Service and PowerApps to illustrate relationships, Option sets, and other data concepts.  This article explains how to install this sample in your own environment and start exploring.
