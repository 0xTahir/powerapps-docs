# Create or edit apps in PowerApps Studio for web
Create and edit apps in PowerApps Studio for web, which opens in a browser window on Windows or other platforms.

## Prerequisites
* [Sign up](../signup-for-powerapps.md) for PowerApps.
* Make sure you're using a [supported browser](limits-and-config.md#supported-browsers-for-powerapps-studio).

## Open PowerApps Studio for web
1. Sign in to [powerapps.com](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=708209).
2. In the lower-left corner, click or tap **New app**.

PowerApps Studio for web opens in a new tab in your browser, where you can create and edit apps in the same way as you can in PowerApps Studio for Windows.

## Known limitations
1. **Create a connection.**

    To [create a connection](add-manage-connections.md) to a data source that requires service authentication, use [powerapps.com](https://web.powerapps.com?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc), and then [add the connection](add-data-connection.md) to an app in PowerApps Studio for web.

2. **Use signal functions.**

    **[Acceleration and Compass](functions/signals.md)** functions return accurate values in a published app, but those functions return zero values as you create or modify an app in a browser.
3. **Export and import data.**

    You can [export and import data](controls/control-export-import.md) in a published app but not as you create or modify an app in a browser.

## Next steps
* Automatically generate an app from your data in, for example, [Excel](get-started-create-from-data.md) or [SharePoint](app-from-sharepoint.md).
* Learn how to [add a control and set properties](add-configure-controls.md) that determine how your app appears and behaves.
* Unleash your creativity by [creating an app from scratch](get-started-create-from-blank.md).
