# Sign in to PowerApps for the first time

When you sign in to [PowerApps](https://web.powerapps.com?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc), the site offers you a variety of options for creating your own apps and opening apps that you or others have created, and performing related tasks. These tasks range from the most simple, such as identifying the license or licenses that give you access, to more advanced capabilities, such as creating custom connections to specific data sources.

You can select options in three general areas:

- the header along the top of the page

    ![Header](media/intro-maker-portal/header.png)

- the navigation bar along the left edge of the page

- the large icons that feature prominently in the middle of the page

    ![Center area of the home page](media/intro-maker-portal/center-area.png)

For best results, start by ensuring that the home page is set to the right environment.

## Choose an environment

Whether you're creating an app, a flow, a data connection, or an entity in the Common Data Service for Apps, much of what you do in PowerApps is contained in a specific environment. Environments create boundaries between different types of work; for example, an organization might have separate environments for different departments. Many organizations use environments to separate apps that are still being developed from those that are ready for widespread use. You might have access to multiple environments or only one and, if you have appropriate permissions, you might be able to create your own environments.

To verify which environment you're in, find the environment switcher near the right side of the header.

If you create an app in one environment, you won't be able to see it from another environment. In addition, people who want to run your app must have access to the environment in which you created it.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure that you're in the right environment *before* you create an app, a flow, or a similar component.

For more information about environments, see [Environments overview](../../administrator/environments-overview.md).

## Open an app

If you've already created an app (or someone else has created one and given you permission to edit it), you can open the app from either the home page or the **Apps** tab.

- On the home page, you can open apps under the **Recent apps** heading. If you hover over an app's tile, you can select the play icon to run the app or the pencil icon to edit it.

- On the **Apps** tab, you can filter the list of apps in multiple ways, such as by whether you opened them recently.

    ![Org apps](media/intro-maker-portal/org-apps.png)

    You can also search for an app by typing one or more characters in the search box near the upper-right corner. When you find the app you want, select the ellipsis icon to show the play icon for running the app and the pencil icon for editing the app.
