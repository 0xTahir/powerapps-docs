# Overview of the email-screen template in PowerApps

In a canvas app, add an email screen that lets users send an email from their Office 365 Outlook account. Users can search for recipients in their org and add external email addresses too. You can add image attachment support, change the user data that appears in the search gallery and make other customizations.

You can also add other template-based screens that show different data from Office 365, such as a user's [calendar](calendar-screen-overview.md), [people](people-screen-overview.md) in an organization, and [availability](meeting-screen-overview.md) of people whom you want to invite to a meeting.

This overview teaches you:
> [!div class="checklist"]
> * The default functionality of the email screen
> * How to modify the screen
> * How to integrate the screen into apps

For a deeper dive into this screen's default functionality, see the [email-screen reference](email-screen-reference.md).

## Prerequisite

Familiarity with how to add and configure screens and other controls as you [create an app in PowerApps](../data-platform-create-app-scratch.md).

## Default functionality

To add an email screen from the template:

1. [Sign in](http://web.powerapps.com?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc) to PowerApps, and then create an app or open an existing app in PowerApps Studio.

    This topic shows a phone app, but the same concepts apply to a tablet app.

1. On the **Home** tab of the ribbon, select **New screen** > **Email**.

    By default, the screen resembles this graphic:

    ![Email screen](media/email-screen/email-screen-full.png)

A few helpful notes:

* To search for users in your org, start typing their name in the text input box below "To".
* When searching for people, only the top 15 results will be returned.
* To add email addresses for email recipients outside your org, type out the full, valid email address and click the '+' icon that appears to the right of it.
* You must add at least one person as a recipient and provide a subject to send an email.
* After you send the email, the contents of the subject line and message body, as well as the recipient list will all be erased.

## Modify the screen

You can modify the default functionality of this screen in a few common ways:

* [Add image attachment support](email-screen-overview.md#add-image-attachment-support)
* [Show different data for people](email-screen-overview.md#show-different-data-for-people)

If you want to modify the screen further, use the [email-screen reference](./email-screen-reference.md) as a guide.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The following steps assume that you've added only one email screen to the app. If you've added more than one, control names (such as **iconMail1**) will end with a different number, and you'll need to adjust the formulas accordingly.

### Add image attachment support

This will allow you to send a single image with your email as an attachment.

1. Under the Media tab in the ribbon, insert the 'Add picture' control and set its 'Y' property to 

	`TextEmailMessage1.Y + TextEmailMessage1.Height + 20`

1. With the **AddMediaWithImage** control inserted, set its height to be less than 210
1. In the control tree view, select the **AddMediaWithImage** control > ... > Reorder > Send to back
    * This will prevent the control from sitting in front of the **PeopleBrowseGallery** control.
1. Change the 'Height' property of the **EmailPeopleGallery** to 

	```powerapps-dot
	Min( 
		( EmailPeopleGallery1.TemplateHeight + EmailPeopleGallery1.TemplatePadding * 2 ) *
			RoundUp( CountRows( EmailPeopleGallery1.AllItems ) / 2, 0 ), 
		304
	)
	```
 
1. Change the 'ShowScrollbar' of the **EmailPeopleGallery** to
 
	```EmailPeopleGallery1.Height >= 304```
	
    * This will prevent the max height from pushing the **AddMediaWithImage** control off the page
1. Change the 'OnSelect' property of the **iconMail** control to:

	```powerapps-dot
    Set( _emailRecipientString, Concat(MyPeople, Mail & ";") );
    If( IsBlank( UploadedImage1 ),
        'Office365'.SendEmail( _emailRecipientString, 
			TextEmailSubject1.Text, 
			TextEmailMessage1.Text, 
			{ Importance: "Normal" }
		),
        'Office365'.SendEmail( _emailRecipientString, 
			TextEmailSubject1.Text, 
			TextEmailMessage1.Text, 
			{
				Importance: "Normal",
            	Attachments: Table(
					{
						Name: "Image.jpg", 
						ContentBytes: UploadedImage1.Image
					}
				)
			}
		)
    );
    Reset( TextEmailSubject1 );
    Reset( TextEmailMessage1 );
    Reset( AddMediaButton1 );
    Clear( MyPeople )
	```
    * This checks if there's an uploaded image. If not, then it uses the same `Office365.SendEmail` operation as before. If there is, the image is added as an attachment in the Attachments table.
    * After sending the email, an additional Reset operation is performed on **AddMediaButton** to remove the uploaded image.
> [!Note]
> To add more than one attachment to an email, add additional records to the Attachments table.

### Show different data for people

This screen uses the [Office365Users.SearchUser](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/office365users/#searchuser) operation to search for users in your org. It provides additional fields for each event beyond what is displayed in the **PeopleBrowseGallery** control. Adding or changing fields in the gallery is simple.

1. In the **PeopleBrowseGallery**, select a label to modify (or add one and keep it selected).

1. With its **Text** property selected, in the formula bar, replace the contents with `ThisItem.`

    Intellisense shows a list of fields that you can select.

1. Select the field that you want.

    The **Text** property should update to `ThisItem.{FieldSelection}`.

## Integrate the screen into an app

The email screen is a powerful bundle of controls in its own right, but it usually performs best as part of a larger, more versatile app. You can integrate this screen into a larger app in a number of ways, including:

* [Linking to the calendar screen](email-screen-overview.md#linking-to-the-calendar-screen)

### Linking to the calendar screen

Follow the steps outlined in the [Calendar screen doc](./calendar-screen-overview.md#show-event-attendees) regarding **Showing event attendees**, but in the final step, set the **Navigate** function to navigate to the email screen. The **MyPeople** collection will be populated by the work done in that section, and you can send an email to the people who are attending the selected event.

> [!Note]
> Sending this email will send a separate email from the actual event in your Outlook.
