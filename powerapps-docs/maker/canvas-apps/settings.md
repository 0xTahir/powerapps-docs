# Settings

This topic outlines how to interpret information and use controls in app
settings.

## License designation

In October 2019, a collection of connectors were reclassified from Standard to
Premium. [Power Apps licensing FAQ](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/powerapps-flow-licensing-faq#office-365) outlines
which connectors were reclassified. Apps using these connectors prior to the
reclassification have been granted an extended timeframe allowing users
without a premium license to access these apps. The following table outlines the designations and which license an end user must have to access an app.

| **Designation​** | **Definition**
|-|-|
| Standard​ | An app that only uses standard connectors. An end user must have a Power Apps for Office 365 plan, per app plan, or a per user plan to access this app.
| Extended​ | An app allowed to use connectors promoted to premium on Oct. 1st, 2019.​ An end user must have a Power Apps for Office 365 plan, per app plan or per user plan. [Power Apps licensing FAQ](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/powerapps-flow-licensing-faq#office-365) outlines which connectors were promoted to premium on Oct. 1st 2019.
| Premium​ | An app that uses at least one premium connector. An end user must have a per app plan or per user plan to access.
