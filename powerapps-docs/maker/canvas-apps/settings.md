# Settings

This topic outlines how to interpret information and use controls in app
settings.

## License designation

In October 2019 a collection of connectors were reclassified from Standard to
Premium.
[This documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/powerapps-flow-licensing-faq#office-365) outlines
which connectors were reclassified. Apps using these connectors prior to the
reclassification have been granted an extended timeframe which allows users
without a premium license to access these apps. The following table outlines the
designations and which license an end user must have to access an app.

| **Designation​** | **Definition**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
