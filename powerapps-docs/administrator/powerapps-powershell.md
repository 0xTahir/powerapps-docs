# PowerShell support for PowerApps (preview)

With the preview launch of the PowerShell cmdlets for app creators and administrators, you can automate many of the monitoring and management tasks that are only possible manually today in the [PowerApps site](https://web.powerapps.com) or [PowerApps Admin Center](https://admin.powerapps.com).

## Installation
To run the PowerShell cmdlets for app creators, you first need to take the following steps:

1. Download the PowerShell scripts file [here](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=872358)

2. Unzip the file into a folder

3. Open a PowerShell command window in that same folder, as an Administrator

4. Then run the following one-time PowerShell command (this presumes you've never run PowerShell commands on the current machine):

    ```
    Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Force
    ```

5. Next import the necessary modules using the following commands:

    ```
    Import-Module .\Microsoft.PowerApps.Administration.PowerShell.psm1 -Force
    Import-Module .\Microsoft.PowerApps.PowerShell.psm1 -Force
    ```

6. Finally before accessing any of the commands, you will need to provide your credentials using the following command. These credentials will be refreshed for up to ~8 hours before you will be required to sign in again to continue using the cmdlets.

    ```
    Add-PowerAppsAccount
    ```
