[Office 365](https://products.office.com/business/enterprise-productivity-tools) is a collection of online services designed to work together to provide enterprise-grade, anywhere access to email, file sharing, and online meetings. [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] includes features that allow administrators to add users, manage passwords and licenses, and much more. [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] takes advantage of the [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] administration features to simplify user management. [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] users are created and managed in the [Office 365 admin center](https://support.office.com/article/About-the-Office-365-admin-center-758befc4-0888-4009-9f14-0d147402fd23).  
  
 A [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)] subscription doesn’t include [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] applications such as [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange_Online](../includes/pn-exchange-online.md)] or [!INCLUDE[pn_sharepoint_online](../includes/pn-sharepoint-online.md)].
