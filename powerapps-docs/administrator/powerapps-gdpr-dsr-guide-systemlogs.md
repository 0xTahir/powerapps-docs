# Responding to DSRs for system-generated logs in PowerApps, Microsoft Flow, and Common Data Service
Microsoft also provides you with the ability to access, export, and delete system-generated logs that may be deemed personal under the GDPR’s broad definition of "personal data." Examples of system-generated logs that may be deemed personal under GDPR include:
* Product and service usage data such as user activity logs
* User search requests and query data
* Data generated by product and services as a product of system functionality and interaction by users or other systems

Note that the ability to restrict or rectify data in system-generated logs is not supported. Data in system-generated logs constitutes factual actions conducted within the Microsoft cloud and diagnostic data, and modifications to such data would compromise the historical record of actions and increase fraud and security risks.

## Accessing and exporting system-generated logs
Admins can access system-generated logs associated with a user’s use of the PowerApps, Microsoft Flow, and Common Data Service services and applications. To access and export system-generated logs:

1. Go to the [Microsoft Service Trust Portal](https://servicetrust.microsoft.com/) and sign in using the credentials of an Office 365 global administrator.

2. In the Privacy drop-down list at the top of the page, click Data Subject Request.

3. On the Data Subject Request page, under System Generated Logs, click Data Log Export. The Data Log Export is displayed. Note that a list of export data requests submitted by your organization is displayed.

4. To create a new request for a user, click Create Export Data Request. After you create a new request, it will be listed on the Data Log Export page where you can track its status. After a request is complete, you can click a link to access the system-generated logs, which will be exported to your organization’s Azure storage location within 30 days of creating the request. The data will be saved in common, machine-readable file formats such as JSON or XML. If you don't have an Azure account and Azure storage location, you'll need to create an Azure account and/or Azure storage location for your organization so that the Data Log Export tool can export the system-generated logs. For more information, see [Introduction to Azure Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-introduction).

The following table summarizes accessing and exporting system-generated logs:

| Question | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| How long does the Microsoft Data Log Export tool take to complete a request? |	This can depend on several factors. In most cases it should complete in one or two days, but it can take up to 30 days.
| What format will the output be in? | The output will be structured machine-readable files such as XML, CSV, or JSON.
| Who has access to Data Log Export tool to submit access requests for system-generated logs? |	Office 365 global administrators will have access to the GDPR Log Manager utility.
| What data does the Data Log Export tool return? |	The Data Log Export tool returns system generated logs that Microsoft stores. Exported data will span across various Microsoft services including Office 365, Azure, Dynamics, PowerApps, Microsoft Flow, and the Common Data Service.
| How is data returned to the user? |	Data will be exported to your organization's Azure storage location; it will be up to admins in your organization to determine how they will show/return this data to users.
| What will data in system-generated logs look like? |	Example of a system-generated log record in JSON format: <br> [{ <br>"DateTime": "2017-04- 28T12:09:29-07:00",  <br> "AppName": "SharePoint", <br> "Action": "OpenFile", "IP": "154.192.13.131", <br> "DevicePlatform": "Windows 1.0.1607" <br>}]

>**Note**: Some features will not allow for the export or deletion of system-generated logs with personal information to maintain the integrity of such information for security and audit reasons.

## Deleting system-generated logs
To delete system-generated logs retrieved through an access request, you must remove the user from the service and permanently delete their Azure Active Directory account. For instructions about permanently delete a user, see the **Deleting a user** section in *Azure Data Subject Request GDPR documentation* that can be found on the [Office 365 Service Trust Portal](https://servicetrust.microsoft.com/ViewPage/GDPRDSR).  It's important to note that permanently deleting a user account is irreversible once initiated. 

Permanently deleting a user account with remove the user’s data from system-generated logs for the PowerApps, Microsoft Flow, and Common Data Service services within 30 days.
