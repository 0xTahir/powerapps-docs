# Administer PowerApps

![overview](./media/introduction-to-the-admin-center/overview.png)  

In the [PowerApps Admin center](https://admin.powerapps.com), you can:

* Manage users, permissions and roles in [environments](environments-administration.md). <!-- (PowerApps P2 plan required)-->
* Manage [data loss prevention policies](prevent-data-loss.md), which control how business data is shared with services in PowerApps. <!--(PowerApps P2 plan or Office 365 Global administrator permissions required)-->

Any changes that you make in the admin center are immediately available to users within the organization.
