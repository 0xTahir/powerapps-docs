> [!NOTE]
> ![This page is under construction. Check back soon!](media/under_construction.png "Coming soon")  [!INCLUDE[cc-under-construction](../includes/cc-under-construction.md)]

When your business is closed for the day (or other time period), configure business closure settings so service activities such as meetings or calls won't be scheduled during that time.

These settings can be found by

|**Closure name**|xxxxx|  
|**Start date**|xxxxxx|  
|**End date**|xxxxxx|  
|**All day event**|xxxxxx|  
|**Start time**|xxxxxx|  
|**End time**|xxxxxx|  
|**Duration**|xxxxxx|
