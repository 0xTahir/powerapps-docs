# Administer PowerApps overview
Administration of PowerApps and the Common Data Service is done through the [PowerApps Admin center]([https://admin.powerapps.com).

![](./media/index/admin-center.png)

The evolution of an organization adopting PowerApps and the Common Data Service starts with the administrator. As an administrator, you begin your journey asking how your organization and users can acquire these services. How do you manage licenses and monitor who's using the services within your organization? You also need to decide how security will work and how you're going to control access to data. What data is accessible through these services? Are there best practices you can follow? Once you have a handle on all of this, you then want to know how you can monitor and manage what users are doing with the services.

When you have control and visibility figured out, the next part of your journey takes you to deployment. Individual users and teams can deploy apps on their own, but how do you centrally deploy solutions for your entire organization? And how do you orchestrate updates and identify and fix issues?

The documentation in this section provides answers to these questions and guides you, no matter where you are on this journey. The information is organized into quickstarts, conceptual articles, and how-to guides, which you can access from the navigation pane on the left.
