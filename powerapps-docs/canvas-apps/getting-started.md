# Introduction to PowerApps
Welcome to PowerApps! PowerApps is a service that lets you build business apps that run in a browser or on a phone or tablet, and no coding experience is required. PowerApps combines visual drag-and-drop concepts from PowerPoint with Excel-like expressions for logic and working with data.

If you're new to app building, PowerApps provides templates and sample data that you can use to quickly build an app, and then you can customize the app to better suit your needs. With some experience and creativity, you'll soon be developing your own apps from scratch. If you're a seasoned developer, you can take advantage of the advanced functionality and truly innovate. If you can imagine it, you can build it!

## Generate an app automatically
It's easy to automatically generate an app in PowerApps. All you need to do is specify where you want your data to come from. Data is stored in a [data source](connections-list.md), and you can use data from a variety of data sources. Here are some common ones:

* Common Data Service (included with PowerApps) - a powerful way to store your business data
* SharePoint
* Excel

You can also generate an app automatically from a template. Each template is based on fictitious data in a cloud account, such as Dropbox. Explore specific screens and UI elements (called [controls](reference-properties.md)) to understand how they're configured, and experiment with customization to discover techniques that you can apply to your own apps.

For more information, check out the following topics:

* [Generate an app from SharePoint](generate-app-from-sharepoint-list-interface.md)
* [Generate an app in PowerApps to manage data in a SharePoint list](app-from-sharepoint.md)
* [Generate an app from Excel](get-started-create-from-data.md)
* [Generate an app from SQL Server](connections/connection-azure-sqldatabase.md)
* [Generate an app from Salesforce](add-manage-connections.md)
* [Generate an app from Dynamics 365](connections/connection-dynamics-crmonline.md)
* [Generate an app from the Common Data Service](data-platform-create-app.md)
* [Generate an app from a template](get-started-test-drive.md)

## Customize an app
If the default generated app doesn't meet your needs, you can customize it. For example, you might want to change the appearance or behavior of certain controls, or perhaps add an image or video. To learn more about customization, in the navigation pane on the left, click or tap **Customize an app**. You'll see a list of topics that pertain to the different things you can customize. Click or tap any of the topics to get step-by-step instructions.

For ideas on how to improve your app further, you can open a sample app to get a sense of what you can do with some creativity and a bit of experience. For more information, see [Use a sample app](open-and-run-a-sample-app.md).

## Create an app from scratch
After you've generated an app or two automatically and gained some experience with customization, you can create an app from scratch. By working from the ground up, you gain flexibility in app design, flow, and controls, and you can incorporate a larger variety of data sources.

For more information, see [Create an app from scratch](get-started-create-from-blank.md).

## Share and run an app
When you finish your app and save it to the cloud, you can then share it with others in your organization. You control the level of permissions on your app - you decide which users or groups can run the app, and whether they can also customize it or share it with additional people in the organization.

You can run your own apps - and any apps shared with you - on Windows, iOS, Android, or in a web browser.

For more information, check out the following topics:

* [Share an app in PowerApps](share-app.md)
* [Use PowerApps in a web browser](../user/run-app-browser.md)
* [Use PowerApps on a phone or tablet](../user/run-app-client.md)

## Get help and support
If you have a question about PowerApps, there are several ways to get help:

* Explore the step-by-step and reference topics in the navigation pane on the left.
* Work through the self-paced [Guided Learning courses](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/guided-learning/).
* Read and post in the [PowerApps Community](https://aka.ms/powerapps-community). This is a place where anyone who uses PowerApps can post a question and others can answer. Before you post a question, search the community to see if your question has already been asked and answered.
* Check out the [upcoming webinars](webinars-listing.md#upcoming-webinars), which can help you leverage the features and functions of PowerApps. You can also access [past webinars](webinars-listing.md#past-webinars) on demand.
* Create a [support ticket](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/support/pro/) to get technical assistance. If you're a PowerApps administrator for your organization, you can also open a support ticket in the [admin portal](https://portal.office.com/Support/Support.aspx).

In addition, we want your help to make PowerApps great!
