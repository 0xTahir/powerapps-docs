# Create a report using the Report Wizard

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

Use the Report Wizard to create reports with charts and tables that allow you to easily analyze your data. 

All reports that are created using the Report Wizard are Fetch-based reports. Note that all reports generated with the Report Wizard print in landscape mode.

## Create a new report

1. From the site map, go to **Reports**.
2. Select **New** on the command bar.

  > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
  > ![Create a new report](media/newport.png "Create a new report")
  
3.  A pop-up will appear. In the Report Type drop-down, leave the default to Report Wizard Report. Select the Report Wizard button.
