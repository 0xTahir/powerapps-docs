# Import contacts

Whether your contacts are stored in an email program, a spreadsheet, or on your phone, here’s how to import them so you have all your business contact information in PowesApps 
  
## Step 1: Get your import file ready  
First, you export your contacts into a Excel file. These file formats are supported are Excel **.xlsx** or **.xml**. 
  
The maximum file size allowed for .zip files is 32 MB. For the other file formats, the maximum file size allowed is 8 MB.  
  
### Export contacts from an email program  
  
1.  Export the contacts into a comma separated values file (.csv).  
  
     To find specific steps to export contacts from your email program, open the program’s Help, and search for “export.” Look for topics that include “exporting contacts” or “exporting your address book” or “export wizard” in the title.  
  
2.  Save the file in a location where you can find it easily later.  
  
### Export contacts from a spreadsheet  
  
1.  Open the spreadsheet.  
  
2.  If necessary, edit any column name in the spreadsheet to match exactly with the corresponding name shown here.  
  
    > [!WARNING]
    >  If the spreadsheet doesn’t include all the column names listed, that’s okay. However, if a column name does exist, it must match exactly with the corresponding name in the list or the import won’t work. Spaces are required. Note that the word “Email” doesn’t contain a hyphen.  

    |**Column Name in Spreadsheet (spelling must match exactly)**|
    |---------|
    |First Name|  
    |Middle Name|  
    |Last Name|  
    |Business Phone|  
    |Mobile Phone|  
    |Job Title|  
    |Business Street|  
    |Business City|  
    |Business State|  
    |Business Postal Code|  
    |Business Country/Region|  
    |Email Address|  
  
3.  Save the file.  
  
### Export contacts from your phone  

Use a USB cable or an app to export your contacts from your phone to your computer.
  
To find specific steps to export contacts for your brand of phone, search for “export contacts from my phone” in your favorite search engine (like Bing).  
  
To find an app, search your phone’s online store.  
  
## Step 2: Import the file 
  
1. On the commbar bar, click **Import from Excel**.  
  
2. Browse to the folder where you saved the file that contains the export of your contacts. Select the file, and then click **Open** and then click **Next**.  
  
   > [!TIP]
   >  You can import only one file at a time. To bring in more files, run the wizard again later.
   
3. Review the file name and verify that the field and data delimiters are correct using the **Review Mapping** option. If everything looks good, click **Finish Import**.  
 
## Step 3: Check that the contacts imported successfully  
 After the wizard finishes, check your list of contacts to make sure they imported correctly.  
  
1. From the main menu, go to **Contacts**.
  
2. Scroll through the contact list. Check that each person is listed and verify the contents of the fields for accuracy.
