**Change the chart view**
 
Changing the chart view shows you a different breakdown of your data, such as opportunities opened within a specific time period. You can change a chart view by selecting the View selector on the Grid page.

For example, choose "All Opportunities", then select a different view, both chart and grid will get refreshed.
