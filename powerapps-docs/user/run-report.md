# Use reports

[!INCLUDE[cc-applies-to-update-9-0-0](../includes/cc_applies_to_update_9_0_0.md)]

Reports help you manage your progress towards your goals by helping you see how you’re doing. You can also track trends - which can give you an advantage over your competitors.  
  
For example it’s important for a sales team to know which product or service is selling and which is not doing so well. For a customer service team, it’s important to track the average time it takes to resolve an issue.  

For more information on organizing and creating reports, see: [Customize and organize reports](../customize/customize-organize-reports.md) and [Introduction to reporting & analytics](../analytics/reporting-analytics-with-dynamics-365.md)
