# Track your progress with charts

Charts in PowerApps, give you a quick view of how you’re tracking to your goals. They’re interactive, so you can tap an area of a chart to get more info.

-   Hover your mouse over the chart to see a tooltip that provides quick info about that area of the chart.

-   Click on the area of a chart to see a grid view with more details about the data in the chart.

-   To expand a chart, from the charts Home page grid, choose the **Expand Chart**  ![Expand chart view](media/expandviewbutton.png "Expand chart view") button.

-   To view records in chart or refresh the chart, choose ![More commands](media/MoreButton.png "More commands") and then choose an  action: **Refresh** or **View Records**.
