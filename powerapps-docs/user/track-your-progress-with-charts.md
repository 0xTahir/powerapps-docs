# Track your progress with dashboards and charts

Dashboards take a collection of app data and provide insights to show key performance indicators (KPI) and other important data in easy-to-read interactive charts and graphs. Dashboards are available for all record types.

Charts provide you a quick view of how you’re tracking to your goals. They’re also interactive, so you can click or tap an area of a chart to get more info.

-   Hover your mouse over the chart to see a tooltip that provides quick info about that area of the chart.

-   Click on the area of a chart to see a grid view with more details about the data in the chart.

-   To expand a chart, click the **Expand Chart**  ![Expand chart view](media/expandviewbutton.png "Expand chart view") button.

-   To view records in chart or refresh the chart, click ![More commands](media/MoreButton.png "More commands") and then choose an  action: **Refresh** or **View Records**.

**Change the chart view**
 
Changing the chart view shows you a different breakdown of your data, such as opportunities opened within a specific time period. You can change a chart view by selecting the View selector on the Grid page.

For example, choose "All Opportunities", then select a different view, both chart and grid will get refreshed.
