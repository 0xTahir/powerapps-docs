# Use filters on a grid

Grids in Unified Interface have been improved to increase the amount of data that can be seen on your screen. There are many different filtering options that are avilable. The type of data in the column determines which filter options are available. For example, the **Full Name** column in the **Contacts** grid will have different filter options than the **Activity Type** column in the **Activites** Gird.

## Date filter

The **Date** filter on grids is a very powerful filter. There are many different filters to choose from, such as **On** to seach by exact date or select filter such as **Next X fiscal year** or **In fiscal period** to search by year.

## Grid and filter navigation 

When you filter data on a grid the page remembers the filter, sort, and the page state when you navigate away and then come back to the page. This includes quick find, column filtering, page number, and more. The navigation outside the page opens with the initial state.


   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Grids remember state](media/grid-remember-state-on-back-navigate.gif "Grids remember state")


The jump bar uses the first sorted field. If no sort change has been made, the jump bar uses the primary field.

   > ![Grids remember state](media/jumpbar-filter-on-sorted-column.gif "Grids remember state")
  
   
When you select the hierarchy icon, it will navigate to the hierarchy form.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Hierarchy icon](media/grid-row-hierarchy-icon.png "Hierarchy icon")
   
You can also open primary field and lookup fields in new tab or window.
