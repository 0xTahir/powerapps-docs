# Use OneNote in your Common Data Service app

If your administrator has set up OneNote integration with Customer Engagement, you can access a OneNote notebook directly from the activities area in Customer Engagement. This doesn't replace the current Notes feature, but gives you another way to access notes stored in OneNote. When you add a OneNote section to a notebook, it's shown individually within Customer Engagement (on-premises) and in order of last modified time.
