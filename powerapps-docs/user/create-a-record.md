# Create a new record


[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

The **Create a new record** command or **Quick create** makes it fast and easy to enter almost any type of information into the system. The command is on the nav bar, so itâ€™s available whenever you need to enter new information into the system. You can also save a record and create a new one directly from the **Quick create** form.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Quick create** option is only available for records that are enabled by your admin.
    
1. On the navigation bar, select the **plus sign** ![Create record button](media/create-record-button.png "Create record button"), and then select the item you want.  
  
2.  Fill in the fields, and then select **Save and Close**. Or, to save and create another record, select the down arrow and then select  **Save & Create New**.

  ![Save a record](media/quick_create.png "Save a record")
  
> [!NOTE]
> An asterisk ![Required Field button](media/required-field-button.png "Required Field button") next to the field on the screen means the field is required. If you select **Save and Close** before entering required fields an error message will be displayed or if you have entered information and select **Cancel** a warning will be displayed.
>   
> A plus sign ![Recommended Field button](media/recommended-field-button.png "Recommended Field button") next to the field on the screen means your organization recommends that you fill in the field.
