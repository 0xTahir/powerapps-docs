# Create a new record


The **Create a new record** command makes it fast and easy to enter almost any type of information into the system. The command is on the nav bar, so itâ€™s available whenever you need to enter new information into the system. When you use this option, you need to complete only a few fields. Later, when you have more time or information, you can fill in more details.  
    
1. On the navigation bar, select the **plus sign** ![Create record button](media/create-record-button.png "Create record button"), and then select the item you want.  
  
2.  Fill in the fields, and then select **Save**.  
  
3.  If you want to continue adding information, select **View Record**. To create another, select **Save & Create New*.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> An asterisk ![Required Field button](media/required-field-button.png "Required Field button") next to the field on the screen means the field is required.  
>   
> A plus sign ![Recommended Field button](media/recommended-field-button.png "Recommended Field button") next to the field on the screen means your organization recommends that you fill in the field.
