#  Basic navigation in a model-driven app 

Use the navigation bar to get to your work area, create a new record, search, or do other tasks in an app.

## Accessing Unified Interface apps on browsers

You can access the installed Unified Interface and web apps from multiple interfaces. On browsers you can see all the apps, both Unified Interface and web:

1. In [Dynamics home](https://home.dynamics.com).

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Dynamics 365 home page](media/home.png "Dynamics 365 home page")

2. In app navigation.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![In app navigation](media/home1.png "In app navigation")

3. In the My Apps page under Settings.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Unified Interface apps on My Apps page](media/home2.png "Unified Interface apps on My Apps page")

## Accessing Unified Interface apps on phones and tablets

Unified Interface apps are the only apps supported on phones and tablets for Dynamics 365, version 9.0. When a user signs in to the above organization, they will see only the Unified Interface apps on their apps landing page.

## Navigation

1. The site map is expanded and persists by default.
2. The sub area that you are currently in is highlighted to indicate where you are in the app.
3. **Recent** and **Pinned** items are at the top for easy access. 
4. Use the Area switcher to switch between apps.
5. Icons have unique colors on the command bar to show differentiation between commands.
  
### Get back to recent records, items, or view
You probably work with the same records most of the time. For example, you might access the same contact or account on a regular basis. Or you might work with the same lists (views) of data over and over. You can quickly get back to recently used records or views from the site map. You can also pin records and views to make them easier to find. 
  
1. From the **Site Map**, select **Recent**.
  
2. Under **Recent**, choose the record, item, or view you want to go back to. 

### Pin records, items, or view

1. From the **Site Map**, select **Recent** to expand the list of recently accessed items.
2. Select the pin icon next to the item in the recent list, and it will be added to the pinned list.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Pinned records](media/pinnedrecords.png "Pinned records")

### Unpin records, items, or view

1. From the **Site Map**, select **Pinned** to expand the list of pinned items.
2. Select the unpin icon next to the item, and it will drop off the list.  

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Unpin records](media/unpinnedrecords.png "Unpin records")

### Record set navigation 
Navigate through multiple records with preset views and queries. The record-focused navigation improves productivity by allowing users to jump from record to record in the list and easily navigate back without losing their working list.

#### Reference panel
The reference panel is a great way to get work done without moving away from the screen you’re on. You can look up other things, like knowledge base articles, within the context of the record you’re viewing.
