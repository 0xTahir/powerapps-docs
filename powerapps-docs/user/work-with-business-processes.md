# Work with business processes

Business process flows provide a guide for users to get work done efficiently. They help you enter data consistently and follow the same steps every time you work with a record. 

For exmaple, as you work on a new customer record, the business process flow helps you see each step that you need to take to create the new record and fill out the required information according to your organizations business process. 

You can dock the business process bar, which helps you focus on the information required in each step.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Business process bar](media/BPdock.png "Business process bar")
 
The process bar can be docked to the right side of the screen for easy reference as you work with a customer record.

For more information on how to work with business process flows, see [Business process flows overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/flow/business-process-flows-overview).
  
 
## What if your business processes looks different from these examples?  

The system comes with business processes for common tasks. However, most organizations customize these processes to match the way they do things. Or, you might have added processes to the system that have been customized for your industry or business goals. In other words, what you see here may not exactly match the process bars you see on your system. But regardless, the process bars work the same for everyone. You enter data in the fields, and then move the customer to the next stage.
