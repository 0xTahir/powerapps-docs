# Manage your SharePoint documents and document locations 

With Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement (on-premises), you can store your documents on SharePoint and manage them from within your app.

The documents that you create in Customer Engagement are stored on SharePoint, and are automatically synced to your desktop and mobile devices.
