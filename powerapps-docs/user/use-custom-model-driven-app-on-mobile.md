# User Guide for model-driven apps

This is an early-access feature. You can opt in early to enable these features in your environment. This will allow you to test these features and then adopt them across your environments. For information on how to enable these features, see [Opt in to 2020 release wave 1 updates](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/opt-in-early-access-updates).

Use the Power Apps mobile app to run model-driven apps on your mobile device. 

For more information on how to install and get started with the app, see [Run canvas app and a model-driven app on a mobile device](run-app-client.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Model-driven apps for sales, customer service, and field service don't run in the Power Apps mobile app. Instead, you use the Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets app. For more information, see [User Guide for Dynamics 365 for phones and tablets](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/mobile-app/dynamics-365-phones-tablets-users-guide).
