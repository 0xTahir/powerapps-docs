#  Basic navigation in a model-driven app 

This introduction explains how to find and open an app, and how to work with its common user interface elements including lists, forms, and business processes.

## Navigating among apps, areas, and entities

A model-driven app is built out of applications (apps), areas, and entities.

- *Apps* provides a collection of functionalities for accomplishing a specific class of activity such as, managing your accounts and contacts. Use the app-selector menu to navigate between the apps that are available to your organization.

- A *work area* is a subdivision of an app, dedicated to a specific feature. Each work area provides a targeted collection of entities for working in that area. In some cases, the same entity appears in more than one area (or even more than one app). The contacts and accounts entities, for example, appear in a variety of apps and work areas. Use the work-area menu to navigate between work areas for your current app.

- *Entities* represent a specific type of data, such as a contacts and accounts. Entities use a structured data format, which defines the collection of fields available to the entity. Each entity consists of a collection of individual records. For example, for the contacts entity, each record describes a single person, and each record includes a collection of fields such as first name, last name, and email address. Entities normally present two views: a list view, which is typically a table listing available records; and a form view, which shows all available data and settings for a single record. Use the side navigator to move between entities in your current work area.

### Move between apps

Use the app-selector menu to switch between apps.

The apps you see listed in your app-selector menu will depend on which apps you have access to. 

### Move between entities, records, and work areas

It's easy to get around and get back to your favorite or most-used records. The following illustration shows the primary navigation elements.
