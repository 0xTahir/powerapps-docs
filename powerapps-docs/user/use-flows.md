# Use Microsoft Flow to automate processes

Microsoft Flow lets you create automated processes between your favorite apps and services. From within your app, you can run a Flow on one or more records. 
Also, you can open Microsoft Flow from your app to view, edit, or create new flows.

## Manage your flows 
Connect with Microsoft Flow from your app to manage your flows. For information: [Get started with Microsoft Flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/flow/getting-started).
  
> [!NOTE]
>  To manage and run Microsoft Flow from your app, Microsoft Flow must be enabled in System Settings for you organization. More information:  [Flows in your organization](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/flow/organization-q-and-a). 
  
## Manage your flows  
 Connect with Microsoft Flow from your app to manage your flows.
