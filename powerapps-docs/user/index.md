# Find and run apps overview
App makers can create customized task- and role-based *canvas* apps that work the way you do, whether you're a mobile worker in the field or a doctor in a busy hospital. Canvas app makers can customize almost every aspect of a canvas app and can connect to multiple data sources to help users complete focused tasks.

App makers can also create *model-driven* apps that are generated from your organization's data. Model-driven apps are complex, responsive apps that help users focus on their work and not on remembering to perform a set of manual steps. Model-driven app makers determine what data an app needs and how it will relate to other data, define the business process that the app will follow, and then add and configure components that enforce that process. Unlike canvas apps, which are highly customizable, the layout of model-driven apps is largely determined by the components that the maker adds to the app.

When app makers are done creating apps, they can instantly publish them to iOS, Android, Windows, and the web, and then share them with others in their organization.

As an app user, you can run apps that you created - or that someone else created and shared with you - on a phone or tablet or in a web browser. You can find apps on the [Dynamics 365 Home page](https://home.dynamics.com/) and in the PowerApps or Dynamics 365 app on your mobile device. You can even find and run apps from Microsoft Team channels, SharePoint, and AppSource. You can also run an app from a URL link, if someone creates an app and shares the link with you in an email.

This section provides information about how to find and run apps, and includes the following articles:

* Run an app in a web browser
* Run a canvas app on a mobile device
* Run a model-driven app on a mobile device
* Add and run an app in Microsoft Teams
* Find and run an app in AppSource

## Next steps
* Ensure that you're using a supported device platform and browser.
* To run canvas apps, download and install PowerApps from the App Store or Google Play on an iPhone, iPad, or Android device.
* To run model-driven apps, download and install Dynamics 365 for Phones or Dynamics 365 for Tablets from the App Store or Google Play on an iPhone, iPad, or Android device.
