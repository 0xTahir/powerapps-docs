# Model-driven and Canvas Apps in Microsoft PowerApps

No need to manually work on a task to get your work done. With PowerApps you can create and use a model-driven app or canvas app to get your work done quickly. Once an app is created, an app maker can share the app with your organization. 

Model-driven apps use the Unified Interface which provides a responsive and accessible design. You can run the app on a web browser or popular mobile devices.  The app has multiple component including dashboards, forms, views, charts, and business processes which together help make the app easy to use.  Model-driven apps are built and modeled on the Dynamics 365 framework, so the user experience is similar to Microsoft Dynamics 365.

Canvas apps give you a lot of control over the user experience of the app. There are templates an app maker can use to make a canvas app, but an app maker can configure the app anyway they like. Just like the name of the app “canvas”, it’s a blank canvas - so you can create an app to the fit the needs of users in your organization.

Since canvas app can essentially be anything, there isn’t much help documentation on how to use an app once it’s created. If you need help using a canvas app, contact your app maker or PowerApps admin.

There is serval ways to run apps. More information: [Find and run apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/user/).
