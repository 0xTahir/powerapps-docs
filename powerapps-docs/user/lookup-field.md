#  Use the lookup field on a record

Lookup helps you to choose records from a related entity (recordset) quickly in Dynamics 365. When you select a related entity and enter search criteria, such as a name or email address, lookup automatically begins to resolve the partial text and displays any matching records. If no records are displayed after you have typed the full text of your search criteria, a message is displayed specifying that there are no records
