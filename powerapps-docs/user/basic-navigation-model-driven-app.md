#  Enhanced user experience with the Unified Interface for Model-driven apps 

The new Unified Interface for Model-driven PowerApps provides a consistent and accessible user experience across devices - whether on a desktop, laptop, tablet, or phone. The apps scales by reflowing the components on the screen. The responsive design adapts to your environment based on screen size, so the more available space that you have the more information can be displayed.

## Navigation

The menu options let you swiftly navigate the different apps in the system. It provides quick access to recently viewed records and pinned favorites.

1. Sitemap is expanded and persists by default.
2. The sub area that you are currently in is highlighted to indicate where in the app.
3. **Recent** and **Pinned** items are at top for easy access. 
4. Use the Area switcher to switch between Apps.
5. There are unique colors for icons on the command bar to show differentiation between commands.
  
### Get back to recent records, items, or view
You probably work with the same records all the time. For example, you may access the same contact or account on a regular basis. Or you may work with the same lists (views) of data over and over. You can quickly get back to recently used records or views from the Site Map. You can also pin records and views to make them easier to find. 
  
1. From the **Site Map**, click **Recent**.
  
2. Under **Recent**, choose the record, item, or view you want to go back to. 

#### Pin records, items, or view

1. From the **Site Map**, click **Recent** to expand the list of recently accessed items.
2. Select the pin icon next to the item in the recent list, and it will be added to the pinned list.

#### Unpin records, items, or view

1. From the **Site Map**, click **Pinned** to expand the list of pinned items.
2. Select the unpin icon next to the item, and it will drop off from the list.

#### Record set navigation 
Navigate through multiple records with pre-set views and queries. The record-focused navigation improves productivity by allowing users to jump from record to record in the list and easily navigate back without losing their working list.

#### Reference panel
The reference panel is a great way to get work done without clicking away from the screen you’re on. You can look up other things, like knowledge base articles, within the context of the record you’re viewing. 

## Dashboards and charts
You can access all the system and user dashboards from within your Unified Interface apps. The interactive dashboards are now available for all record types with richer interactive dashboard capabilities. For more information, [Track your progress with dashboards and charts](track-your-progress-with-dashboard-and-charts.md).

## Timeline control 
The timeline view helps you collaborate with your team by tracking customer communication in a record on a single page in an easy to read view. You can see everything from posts and voice attachments, to emails and notes. It provides a quick way to see the entire communication thread. For more information, [Add an appointment, email, phone call, notes or task activity to the Timeline](add-activities.md).

## Business process 
The business process flow has been improved by the docking mechanism. You can dock the business process stage on your screen to help you stay focused on the task at hand in your business process flow. This is especially useful when the stage of the process has complex steps to complete. For more information, [Work with business processes](work-with-business-processes.md).

## Accessibility
The improved accessibility experience lets you use screen readers to translates on-screen information into audible sound and print to a braille reader - so that more people can use the app. For more information, [Use a screen reader](screen-reader.md).
