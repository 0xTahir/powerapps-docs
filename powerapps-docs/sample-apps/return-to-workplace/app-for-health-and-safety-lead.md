1.  Open – In this stage the Health & Safety lead can record basic information
    regarding the case.

2.  Investigating – In this stage the Health & Safety Lead is performing steps
    to ensure the employee checks and screenings are being completed as per
    their company policy. The end result of these checks is a clear instruction
    to the employee. When this is communicated to the employee, the case can
    move towards the next stage.

3.  Monitoring – After the investigating stage is complete and employee has been
    provided with instructions/guidelines they are monitored until they are
    healthy enough to be eligible to return to the workplace

4.  Resolve – case is closed

# Getting started with the Case Management app

Employee Safety is the main goal for the Health & Safety Lead. Therefor the
Employee Case allows the Health & Safety Lead to revoke the employee's ability
to check into a workplace facility. The goal of case management is to provide
clear insight into the work backlog and to make sure that the managing of all
cases follow the same process.

**At the case level, no additional personal or privacy related information is
stored or gathered. The case must be regarded as a checklist that proper
procedures have been applied**
