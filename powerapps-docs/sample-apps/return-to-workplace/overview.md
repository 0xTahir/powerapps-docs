# Return to Workplace

The Regional Government Emergency Response and Monitoring solution provides a set of capabilities for state and local governments to collect and visualize health system data from all the parent organizations and associated hospitals in their network or region to establish situational awareness during emergency responses. The data includes information about available beds, supplies, equipment, COVID-19 patients, and staffing.

The main components of the Regional Government Emergency Response and Monitoring solution are:

-   **Dashboard for Executive Leaders (PBI)** to review current data
    related to all of their workplaces as it relates to Covid-19 conditions and
    facility readiness factors. Theses dashboards provide a comparison of
    selected measures and metrics associated to established goals/targets for
    facilities in their locations and respective phase rules/guidelines set for
    them by government agencies.

-   **Power App for Facility Managers (Model App)** to develop and execute on
    reopening plans.

-   **Power App for Employees (Canvas App)** will be used by employees that are
    seeking to return to the workplace. Employees can use this app to identify
    open buildings and self-attest to no symptoms prior to returning to a
    reopened workplace.

-   **Power App for Health & Safety Lead (Model App)** to manage cases for
    employees under investigation.
