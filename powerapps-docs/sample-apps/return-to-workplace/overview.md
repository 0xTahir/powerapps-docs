# Return to Workplace

The Return to Workplace solution provides a set of capabilities for organizations to setup and manage plans to get their employees to return to their workplace while aligning with governmental COVID-19 mandates and guidelines. This solution is focused on enabling organizations to open their offices and providing all its employees with a healthy and safe workplace.

The main components of the Return to Workplace solution:

- **Dashboard for Executive Leadership** to review current data related to all of their workplaces as it relates to Covid-19 conditions and facility readiness factors. Theses dashboards provide a comparison of selected measures and metrics associated to established goals/targets for facilities in their locations and respective phase rules/guidelines set for them by government agencies.

- **Facility Manager App** used to develop and execute on reopening plans.

- **Employee App** used by employees that are seeking to return to the workplace. Employees can use this app to identify open buildings and self-attest to no symptoms prior to returning to a reopened workplace.

- **Case Management App** used to manage cases for employees under investigation.
