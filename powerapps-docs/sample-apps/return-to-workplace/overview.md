# Return to the Workplace solution

The Return to Workplace solution provides a set of capabilities for organizations to set up and manage plans to get their employees to return to their workplace while aligning with governmental COVID-19 mandates and guidelines. This solution is focused on enabling organizations to open their offices and providing employees with a healthy and safe workplace.

The main components of the Return to Workplace solution:

- **Dashboard for executive leadership** to review the current data related to all of their workplaces as it relates to COVID-19 conditions and facility readiness factors. Theses dashboards provide a comparison of selected measures and metrics associated with established goals or targets for facilities in their locations and respective phase rules or guidelines set for them by government agencies.

- **Facility manager app** used to develop and execute on reopening plans.

- **Employee app** used by employees that are seeking to return to the workplace. Employees can use this app to identify open buildings and self-attest to no symptoms prior to returning to a reopened workplace.

- **Case management app** used to manage cases for employees under investigation.
