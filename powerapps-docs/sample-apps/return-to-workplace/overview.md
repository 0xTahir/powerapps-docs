# Return to the Workplace solution

The Return to the Workplace solution enables organizations to reopen workplaces responsibly and empower their employees to return to the workplace confidently by providing a healthy and safe workplace as per the governmental COVID-19 guidelines to ensure their wellbeing.

The main components of the Return to the Workplace solution:

- **Dashboard for location readiness** to review and determine readiness of their workplaces for COVID-19 conditions and efficiently manage their safe reopening. These dashboards allow facility managers and task force leaders to make informed decision by comparing selected measures and metrics associated with established goals or targets for facilities in their locations and respective COVID guidelines set by government agencies.

- **Facility manager app** used to develop and execute on reopening plans.

- **Employee return to workplace app** to empower employees to use self-service tools for returning confidently to the reopened workplace and work safely. Employees can use the app to identify open buildings and self-attest to no symptoms before returning to a reopened workplace.

- **Case management app** used to manage cases for employees under investigation.
