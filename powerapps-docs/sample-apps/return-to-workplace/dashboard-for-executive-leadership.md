# Use the Power BI dashboard

This article is for executive leaders who use the Power BI dashboard to analyze data to get their employees back to their office locations using the Return to the Workplace solution. The following steps will be covered in this article:

- [System at a glance](#system-at-a-glance)

- [Virus spread](#virus-spread)

-  [Facility at a glance](#facility-at-a-glance)

-  [Employee activity](#employee-activity)


## How to view the leadership dashboard

To access the dashboard:

1. Open the Power BI dashboard.

2. In the search bar, search for **Return to the Workplace – Leadership**.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Search for dashboard](media/pbi-dash-command-bar.png "Search for dashboard")

## System at a glance

The system at a glance section provides main key metrics regarding returning to work, including current value, goal values, and if they have met the goals or not. These key metrics are the number of COVID-19 new cases per day, fatality cases per day, new cases per day for million population, fatality cases per day for million population, reproductive
number, and facility Readiness checklist completion percentage.

A map highlights facilities location, along with the number of facilities in a certain phase.

Some important statistics are provided on the left side, which includes the number of facilities, facility groups, attestations, and the number of employees for happy, Neutral, and Sad sentiments.

### Slicer

Slicer helps the user to quickly slice and dice the data, focusing on only interested data points. The country or state slicer lets the user select the country and state they are interested. This slicer supports functions like multiple selections, hierarchy category selections, search, and clean
selections.

### Drill through page

From the system at a glance tab, we can drill down data to related **Facility at a Glance** tab. Two ways getting to  the **Drill-Through Facility at a Glance** page:

1. Right-click and select **Drill through**.

   > ![Facility at glance](media/pbi-dash-selected-facility-details.png "Facility at glance")

## Virus spread

Virus spread section has COVID-19 cases and reproductive numbers for the country and the state or province level.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Reproductive factor](media/pbi-dash-virus-spread-reproductive-number.png "Reproductive factor")

### Toggle button

The toggle button helps to navigate to another section or topic quickly. The highlighted color indicates the current section or topic.

Example 1 (on top of each page):

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Toggle button one](media/pbi-dash-toggle-button1.png "Toggle button one")

Example 2 (on Virus Spread Page):

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
> ![Toggle button two](media/pbi-dash-toggle-button-virus-spread-page.png "Toggle button two")

## Facility at a glance

Different from the system at a glance’s overall view, facility at a glance tab will let users drill down to each facility, track details of facility open readiness
and employee sentiment, and attestation. It helps executive leaders to monitor all kinds of key metrics and decide the facility’s opening phase.

## Employee activity 

Employee activity provides an overall time-series view for employee sentiment and attestation daily. Executive leaders can check every day and see
where numbers were raised or lower compared to previous days.

### Tooltip

By hovering over the transition part of the ribbon chart, users can quickly get an
insight on number changes on the tooltip.
