# Use the facility manager app

The facility manager app provides step-by-step instructions to facility managers in organizations on how to use the app to manage the reopening and readiness of the facilities. This helps the organizations ensure that they can provide a safe working environment for employees to return to the workplace using the Return to Workplace solution.

This article has the following sections:

- [Manage and monitor facilities](#manage-and-monitor-facilities)

- [Moving a facility to a new phase](#moving-a-facility-to-a-new-phase)

- [Monitor employee attestations](#monitor-employee-attestations)

- [Monitor employee sentiments](#monitor-employee-sentiments)


## Facility manager app at a glance

The left pane lists all the components available in the **Facility Management** area.

## Facility manager app components

The facility manager app has the following components:

**Facility Management**

-  **Facilities**-  List of the facilities (e.g. buildings, plants, etc.) that require monitoring to reopen.

-  **Facility Groups** - Provides a flexible way to group facilities. For example, by campus, or geographical region.

-  **Areas** - Areas are sub components of a facility. This is used to distinguish
    the capacity of these sub components over the various phases.

**Reopen Readiness**

-  **Phase Transitions** - A phase transition is used to create a request to transition to a new phase. When the transition is approved, the facility will be updated with the proposed phase.

-  **Readiness Factors** -  Readiness Factors are basically yes/no type questions regarding reopening a building. They are linked per Reopening Phase to a checklist on a facility.

- **Measurements** -  The actual values for a metric. This allows to track parameters over time. For a single metric, measurements can be entered per facility.

**Employee**

- **Employee Sentiment** -  Keeps track of general employee wellbeing. This is self-reported information, but it is a valuable parameter when tracked consistently over time and with bigger groups. This data is typically entered by employees using the employee app.

- **Employee Attestation** - Keeps track of employee health assessments or attestations based upon a series of questions answered by the employee. This data is typically entered by employees using the employee app.

### Monitor Facility

Facility manager can monitor and assesses the current status of their facilities
by reviewing the facilityâ€™s associated dashboard, details, checklist, and
transitions. To monitor a facility.

1. Select **Facility** from  the left pane to see the list of active facilities

2. Select a desired facility record to access the facility data. The **General** tab shows the facility manager dashboard. The dashboard shows the COVID-19 data based on the address details of the facility, checklist completion for the current phase, employee attestation, and employee sentiment. More information: [Power BI dashboard]().

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Facility at glance](media/facility-manager-facility-at-glance.png "Facility at glance")

3. Select **Details** tab for the selected facility
 
   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Select details ](media/facility-manager-facility-form-populated.png "Select details")

4. Select **Checklist** tab for the selected facility to see checklist items and their completion status.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![](media/facility-manager-checklist-2.png)

5. Select **Transitions** tab for the selected facility to see any related transition requests and their status.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![](media/facility-manager-facility-transitions.png)

### Updating the checklist

The **Checklist** tab contains a canvas app displaying the check in the checklist for the current facility or phase combination. The app provides an easy way for the users to find checks by category and then update the individual checks, where applicable. To locate and update checks:

1. Select **Facilities** from the left pane to see the list of active facilities

2. Select a desired facility to access the facility data

3. Select **Checklist** tab for the selected facility to see the checklist items and their completion status.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Checklist](media/facility-manager-checklist-1.png "Checklist")

4. Select the category from the **Categories** drop-list that you want to search
    within to locate the checks you want to review or update.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
   > ![Category drop-list](media/facility-manager-categories-droplist.png "Category drop-list")

5. Select the checkbox to confirm the check is completed.

6. Add comments in the provided text box and select **Save** that appears next to the text entered.

    > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]
    > ![Add comments](media/facility-manager-facility-completed-check.png "Add comments")

## Moving facility to a new phase

When a facility manager asserts that a facility should be moved to a new phase,
the manager can apply for a transition. Only the facility manager can create
a new transition record that indicates the new phase and his rationale to do so.
A reviewer must **Accept** or **Reject** the transition. Either way the transition
record is closed and stored as a historical track record. When the transition is
accepted, the proposed phase is applied to the facility.

The new phase comes with its own set of metrics, goals, and checklist. These
will be made available on the facility by a background process. So there will be
a small delay between accepting a transition and the actual changes on the
facility record.

A reviewer, for instance a facility manager supervising many facility managers
in a facility group, can find the backlog in the phase transitions sub area. For example, the list can be filtered by facility group or by reviewer to find out that the phase transitions requires his or her attention.

## Monitor employee attestations

Facility managers can monitor whether or not their organizationâ€™s employees are
feeling healthy enough to be eligible to return to their facility. They are able
to track employee self-attestations of their health based upon a series of
questions presented to and answered by the employees. This data will typically
be entered through employeeâ€™s use of the Return to Workplace solutionâ€™s canvas
app and available at a summary level in the Facility Manager Appâ€™s **Employee
Attestations** sub-area.

## Monitor employee sentiments

Keeps track of general employee sentiment on how they are feeling about the
prospect of returning to their workplace facility. This information is
self-reported information, but it is a valuable parameter when tracked
consistently over time and with bigger groups. This data will typically be enter
through employeeâ€™s use of the Return to Workplace solutionâ€™s canvas app and can
be viewed by Facility Managers at a summary level in the Facility Manager Appâ€™s **Employee
Sentiment** sub-area.
