# Model apps for developers

PowerApps model apps offers customers, partners, independent software vendors (ISVs), and systems integrators (SIs) a powerful platform for building line-of-business apps. 

Business apps typically model and track connections between various types of business data (people, places, and things). Model apps provide for declarative development of relational business applications with flexible data models and web services. In addition to the declarative app capabilities, model apps can be extended and integrated with external systems through a set of web services and behaviors can be added to the client using a client API.
