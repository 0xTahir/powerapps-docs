# Create Controls using PowerApps Control Framework Tooling

[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

This topic shows how to create custom controls using **PowerApps CLI (Command Line Interface)**. Use the **PowerApps CLI** to create, debug and deploy custom controls. **The PowerApps CLI** will enable developers to quickly create PCF controls and in the coming months the set of capabilities will expand to include plugin development and aid the **Microsoft** recommended **Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) processes**.

**Microsoft PowerApps CLI** is a simple, single-stop developer command line interface which offers you everything that is required to create a custom control and enable you to perform all the development tasks via a simple and efficient set of commands. The **PowerApps CLI** is the first step towards a comprehensive **ALM** story where Enterprise developers and ISVs can create, build, debug and publish their extensions and customizations quickly and efficiently. The significance here is a shift towards a source centric approach, to provide better support for continuous validation starting from internal development loop through to AppSource publishing and end-customer deployment. 
 
Developers will be empowered to identify problems early and operations like adding a component to a solution, or publishing to upstream environments can be automated with simple tasks as we enable deeper integration with **Azure DevOps**.

## Prerequisites to use PowerApps CLI

To use PowerApps CLI you will need the following: 

- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
- Install CLI from NuGet (path to be provided). 
- Install the PCF modules (includes typescript) from `npm` by using tge command `npm install pcf-scripts`.  
- Install Visual Studio Code (optional).  
- To deploy your custom control, you will need Common Data Service for Apps environment with System administrator or System customizer privileges.

## Creating custom controls

To get started, open a command line interface (**PowerShell**).

1. Create a new folder where desired on your local hard drive.
2. Use a single command to create a new control project with some basic parameters
 `pac pcf init --namespace <specify your namespace here> --name <put control name here> --template <control type>`
 
> [!NOTE]
>Today we offer two types of controls field and dataset.

3. To retrieve all required project dependencies, run the command `npm install`.
4. Open your project in any developer environment of your choice and get started with your custom control development.
5. Implement the custom logic for the control. More information: [Implementing custom controls using TypeScript](implementing-controls-using-typescript.md).
6. To build your control you can use **Visual Studio Code** by using the (Ctrl-Shift-B) command, then selecting your build options or you can build your control quickly using `npm run build` command.

## Telemetry

The feature team is aggregating anonymized telemetry in order to understand which features/capabilities in the **Microsoft PowerApps CLI** tool are most often used by developers. The aggregated data allows us to provide the best experience to our customers by focusing on whatâ€™s truly important.

If for any reason you would like to disable telemetry collection, run the command `pac telemetry - -enabled false`. To turn telemetry back on, use the  command `pac telemetry- -enabled true`.
