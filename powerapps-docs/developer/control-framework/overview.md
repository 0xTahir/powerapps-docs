# PowerApps component framework

[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Use the **PowerApps component framework** to create custom controls in Common Data Service to provide enhanced user experience for the users to view and work with data in forms, views and dashboards. For example:

- Replace a field that displays a numeric text value with a `dial` or `slider` control.
- Transform a list into an entirely different visual experience bound to the data set like a `Calendar` or `Map`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - The PowerApps component framework is a preview feature.
> - [!INCLUDE[cc_preview_features_definition](../../includes/cc-preview-features-definition.md)] 
> - [!INCLUDE[cc_preview_features_no_MS_support](../../includes/cc-preview-features-no-ms-support.md)]

Majority of the controls found in Common Data Service that uses the **Unified Interface** are implemented using the **PowerApps component framework**. Custom controls are metadata driven, configurable, reusable, solution aware and responsive. As a developer, you will implement an interface and the application will take care of the rest.

> [!NOTE]
> Custom controls are supported only on Unified Interface for [model-driven apps](/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/model-driven-app-overview).
