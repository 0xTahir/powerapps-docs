# PowerApps component framework for canvas apps

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature is still experimental and disabled by default. For more information, see [Experimental and preview features](../../maker/canvas-apps/working-with-experimental.md).

Component developers and app makers can utilize modern web practices and also harness the power of external libraries to create advanced user interactions. The framework automatically handles component lifecycle, retains application business logic and optimizes the performance. more information: [PowerApps component framework overview](overview.md) 

> [!WARNING]
> Custom components contain code that may not be generated by Microsoft and can potentially access security tokens and data. When adding custom components to an app, make sure that the custom component solutions are from trusted source.

## Prerequisites

1. System Administrator privileges is required to enable PowerApps component feature in the environment.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> By default PowerApps component framework is enabled in model-driven apps.

## Enable PowerApps component framework feature

PowerApps code components need to be enabled in each environment where they are to be used.  To enable an environment to use PowerApps components inside its apps:

1. Sign in to [PowerApps](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/).

2. Click on the **Settings** icon and then select **Admin Center**
    
    ![Settings admin center](media/select-admin-center-from-settings.png "Settings admin center") 

3. Select the environment where you want to enable this feature and click on **...** and then select **Settings**

4. Under the **Products** tab, select **Features**

   ![Enable PCF](media/enable-pcf-feature.png "Enable PCF")

5. From the list of available features, turn on the switch under the **PowerApps component framework for canvas apps**

## Implementing custom components

After you enable the PowerApps component framework feature in your environment, you can start implementing the custom components. [Implement sample component](implementing-controls-using-typescript.md) topic demonstrates step by step process to create custom components right from implementing custom logic, manifest file, debug process, and creating a solution zip file.

> [!NOTE]
> Implementing custom components is same for both model-driven apps and canvas apps (experimental preview). The only difference is adding the custom components. 

## Add components to a canvas app

To add custom components to a canvas app:

> [!NOTE]
> To add custom components to a field or an entity for model-driven apps, see [Add custom components to model-driven apps](add-custom-controls-to-a-field-or-entity.md)

1. Navigate to PowerApps Studio.
2. Create a new canvas app or edit an existing app that you want to add the custom component to.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Make sure the custom components solution zip file is already [imported](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/import-update-export-solutions) into Common Data Service before you go onto the next step.

3. Click on **Insert** > **Components** > **Import component**. 
 
    ![Insert components](media/insert-components-import.png "Insert components")

4. Select **Code (experimental)** tab and add a component from the list and click on **Import**. This adds the sample component in the **Components** menu.

    ![Import sample component](media/import-component-add-sample-component.png "Insert sample component")

5. Navigate to **Components** and select the component to add it to the app.

   ![Add sample component](media/add-sample-component-from-list.png "Add sample component")

## Known limitations

1. Only the field type of components are supported in experimental preview and not the data set type. 
2. Common Data Service dependent APIs including WebAPI along with few other APIs are not available for this experimental preview. For individual API availability for experimental preview release, see [PowerApps component framework API reference](reference/index.md)
