# Package a custom component

This topic demonstrates how to import custom components into Common Data Service. After developing the custom components using the PowerApps CLI, the next step is to import those components, so that you can see the components in runtime.

Follow the steps below to create and import a solution file:

1. Create a new solution project in the directory of your choice using the command `pac solution init --publisher-name <enter your publisher name> --publisher-prefix <enter your publisher name>` after `cd <your new folder>`. The solution project is used for packaging the custom component into a solution zip file which is used for importing to your environment.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The `publisher-name` and `publisher-prefix` values must be unique to your environment.
 
2. Once the new solution project gets created, you need to refer to the location where the created component is located. You can add the reference using the below command. This reference, tells the solution project which custom components should be added during the build, and you can add references to multiple components in a single solution project.

    ```CLI   
    pac solution add-reference --path<path of your PowerApps component framework project on disk>
    ```

3. To generate a zip file from your solution project, you need to `cd` into your solution project directory and build the project using the command `msbuild /t:build /restore`. This command uses MSBuild to build your solution project by pulling down NuGet dependencies as part of the restore. Use the `/restore` only for the first time when the solution project is built. For every build afterward, you can run the command `msbuild`.

    > [!NOTE]
    > - If msbuild 15.9.* is not in the path, open Developer Command Prompt for VS 2017 to run the `msbuild` commands.    
    > - Building the solution in the *debug* configuration generates an unmanaged solution package. A managed solution package is generated by building the solution in *release* configuration. These settings can be overridden by specifying SolutionPackageType property in cdsproj file.
    > - You can set the msbuild configuration to `Release` to issue a production build. Example: `msbuild /p:configuration=Release` 

4. After build completes, the generated solution files are located in `\bin\debug\`.
5. Manually [Import solution to model-driven apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-engagement/customize/import-update-export-solutions) using the web portal once the zip file is ready.
8. To manually import solutions into canvas apps, see the topic [Import solutions into canvas apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/import-update-export-solutions)


## How to remove components from a solution

If you would like to remove a custom component from a solution, follow the steps below:

1.	Edit the cdsproj file in your solution project directory and remove the reference to the component. Below is an example of a component reference:

```XML
<ItemGroup>
    <ProjectReference Include="..\pcf_component\pcf_component.pcfproj">
      <Project>0481bd83-ffb0-4b70-b526-e0b3dd63e7ef</Project>
      <Name>pcf_component </Name>
      <Targets>Build</Targets>
      <ReferenceOutputAssembly>false</ReferenceOutputAssembly>
      <OutputItemType>Content</OutputItemType>
      <CopyToOutputDirectory>Always</CopyToOutputDirectory>
    </ProjectReference>
</ItemGroup>
```

2.	Perform a rebuild (or clean) by running the command
   ```CLI
   msbuild /t:rebuild
   ```
