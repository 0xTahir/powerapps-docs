# Package a custom component

This topic demonstrates how to import custom components into Common Data Service. After developing custom components using the PowerApps CLI, next step is to import those components, so that you can see the components in runtime.

Follow the steps below to create and import a solution file:

1. Create a new solution project in the directory of your choice by using the command `pac solution init --publisher-name <enter your publisher name> --publisher-prefix <enter your publisher name>` after `cd <your new folder>`. The solution project is used to package the custom component into a solution zip file which can be used for importing to your environment.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The `publisher-name` and `publisher-prefix` values must be unique to your environment.
 
2. Once the new solution project is created, you need to refer to the location where the created component is located. You can add the reference by using below command. This reference, tells the solution project which custom components to package during build and you can add references to multiple components in a single solution project.
`pac solution add-reference --path <path of your PowerApps component framework project on disk>`
3. To generate a zip file from your solution project, you will need to `cd` into your solution project directory and build the project using the command `msbuild /t:build /restore`. This command uses MSBuild to build your solution project by first pulling down nuget dependencies as part of restore. Please note that the `/restore` has to be used only the first time a solution project is built. For every build afterwards you can simply run `msbuild`.

    > [!NOTE]
    > - If msbuild 15.9.* is not in the path, open Developer Command Prompt for Vs 2017 to run the msbuild commands.    
    > - Building the solution in the *debug* configuration generates an unmanaged solution package. A managed solution package is generated by building the solution in *release* configuration. These settings can be overridden by specifying SolutionPackageType property in cdsproj file.
    > - You can set the msbuild configuration to `Release` to issue a production build. Example: `msbuild /p:configuration=Release` 

4. After build completes, the generated solution files are located in `\bin\debug\`.
5. You can now manually import the solution using the web portal.

## How to remove components from a solution

If you would like to remove a custom component from a solution, follow the steps below:

1.	Edit the cdsproj file in your solution project directory and remove the reference to the component. Below is an example of a component reference:

```XML
<ItemGroup>
    <ProjectReference Include="..\pcf_component\pcf_component.pcfproj">
      <Project>0481bd83-ffb0-4b70-b526-e0b3dd63e7ef</Project>
      <Name>pcf_component </Name>
      <Targets>Build</Targets>
      <ReferenceOutputAssembly>false</ReferenceOutputAssembly>
      <OutputItemType>Content</OutputItemType>
      <CopyToOutputDirectory>Always</CopyToOutputDirectory>
    </ProjectReference>
</ItemGroup>
```

2.	Perform a rebuild (or clean) by running the command
   ```CLI
   msbuild /t:rebuild
   ```
