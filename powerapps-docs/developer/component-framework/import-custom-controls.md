# Packaging a custom component

This topic demonstrates how to import custom components into model-driven apps. After developing your custom components using the PowerApps CLI, the next step is to import those components, so that you can see the components in runtime.

 > [!NOTE]
 > To deploy your custom component, you need to have System Administrator or System Customizer privileges.

Follow the steps below to create and import a [solution](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/customize/solutions-overview) file:

1. Create a new directory inside the root custom component folder. 

2. Create a new solution project in the newly created folder using the command

    ```CLI
     pac solution init --publisherName <enter your publisher name> --customizationPrefix <enter your publisher name>
    ``` 

   > [!NOTE]
   > The [publisherName](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/reference/entities/publisher) and [cutomizationPrefix](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/change-solution-publisher-prefix) values must be unique to your environment.
 
3. Once the new solution project is created, you need to refer to the location where the created components are located. You can add the reference using the command

    ```CLI
    pac solution add-reference --<path of your PowerApps component framework project on disk>
    ```

4. To generate a zip file from your solution project, you will need to `cd` into your solution project directory and build the project using the command `msbuild/t:restore` and `msbuild`

    > [!NOTE]
    > If msbuild 15 is not in the path, open **Developer Command Prompt for Vs 2017** to run the msbuild commands.

     > [!NOTE]
    > Building the solution in the debug configuration, generates an unmanaged solution package. A managed solution package is generated by building the solution in release configuration. These settings can be overridden by specifying SolutionPackageType property in `cdsproj` file.
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > If you would like your project build to emit a managed solution or both managed and unmanaged, open the folder where you created your solution project, edit the `cdsproj` file and uncomment the below property group:
      ```XML
         <PropertyGroup>
          <SolutionPackageType>Managed</SolutionPackageType>
           </PropertyGroup>
      ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can also enable additional solution packaging [capabilities](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/developer/compress-extract-solution-file-solutionpackager) by adding any of the property group elements below:

     ```XML
       <PropertyGroup>
         <SolutionPackageErrorLevel />
         <SolutionPackageEnableLocalization />
        <SolutionPackagerWorkingDirectory />
        <SolutionPackageLogFilePath />
        <SolutionPackageZipFilePath />
        <SolutionPackageMapFilePath />
       </PropertyGroup>
     ```

5. The generated solution files are located in `\bin\debug\`.
6. You should manually [import the solution](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/customize/import-update-export-solutions) using the web portal once the zip file is ready.
