# Get Microsoft PowerApps Command Line Interface (CLI)

[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Microsoft PowerApps CLI is a simple, single-stop developer command line interface enabling you to create custom component. PowerApps CLI is also the first step towards a comprehensive ALM story where enterprise developers and ISVs can create, build, debug and publish their PowerApps and Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement apps extensions and customizations quickly and efficiently.
