# Authentication with .NET Framework applications

If you are using the .NET Framework you can use classes within the [Xrm.Tooling](/dotnet/api/?view=dynamics-xrmtooling-ce-9) namespace to authenticate and connect to the Organization service and the Web Api.

With `Xrm.Tooling` classes you can use the SDK assemblies using the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService> interface methods. This is the same style of programming used by plug-ins and workflow activities, making it one style that you can use everywhere for .NET Framework applications.

With the `Xrm.Tooling` classes, use the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Tooling.Connector>.<xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Tooling.Connector.CrmServiceClient> class.

> [!NOTE]
> You may find older code or samples using the low-level <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Client.OrganizationServiceProxy> or <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.WebServiceClient.OrganizationWebProxyClient> classes. These remain supported and are not deprecated, but we recommend you use <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Tooling.Connector.CrmServiceClient> for new .NET Framework Client Applications.

The `Xrm.Tooling` classes provide many benefits including:
- You can define connection information using a connection string.
- Supports both OAuth and Office 365 claims-based authentication.
- Thread safety for actions performed in a multithreaded environment. 
- A common Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) login control for a consistent sign-in experience from your Windows client applications.
- Supports for secure storage of the sign-in credentials and reuse of the stored credentials to automatically sign in after initial sign in.
- Built-in diagnostic tracing and performance reporting of the actions performed, which you can configure based on your organizationâ€™s requirements.
- Support for X.509 certificate authentication.

The `Xrm.Tooling` classes are optimized to use the <xref:Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.IOrganizationService> interface methods. If you want to use the Web API, you can use the `ExecuteCrmRequest` method to compose requests using the Web API with all the other benefits provided with the `Xrm.Tooling` classes as long as you use OAuth.

## .NET Framework versions

Use .NET Framework version 4.6.2 or higher when you create client applications. Only applications using Transport Level Security (TLS) 1.2 or better security will be allowed to connect. TLS 1.2 is not the default protocol used by .NET Framework 4.5.2, but it is in .NET Framework 4.6.2.

> [!NOTE]
> When developing Plug-in and workflow activity assemblies, which do not require authentication, use .NET Framework 4.5.2

## .NET Framework applications without SDK assemblies

If you prefer to not have a dependency on any SDK assemblies, you can also use the patterns described in [Use OAuth with Common Data Service for apps](authenticate-oauth.md) without taking a dependency on any SDK assemblies. Without the SDK assemblies, you can only use the OData Restful web services (Web API and OData Global Discovery Service). The current Web API C# samples demonstrate this approach.
