# Saved Queries

<!-- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/developer/userquery-saved-view-entity 

This topic needs to be adapted to describe the concept of saved queries, both user-queries and systemviews

It should cover using these messages 

ExecuteByIdUserQuery 
ExecuteByIdSavedQuery

And support the Web API content here:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/developer/webapi/retrieve-and-execute-predefined-queries
