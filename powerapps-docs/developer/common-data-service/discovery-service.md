# Discovery Service

[!INCLUDE [cc-discovery-service-description](includes/cc-discovery-service-description.md)]


The Discovery Service is accessed through two different APIs:

- For the Web API (REST): [Discover the URL for your organization using the Web API](webapi/discover-url-organization-web-api.md)
- For the Organization Service (SOAP): [Use the Discovery Service with the Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Discovery NameSpace](org-service/discovery-service.md)

> [!NOTE]
> The *regional* Discovery Service in Organization Service (SOAP) and Web API (REST) is deprecated. More information: [Important changes (deprecations)](/power-platform/important-changes-coming.md).
