# Common Data Service Developer Guide

PowerApps offers users, businesses, independent software vendors (ISVs), and systems integrators (SIs) a powerful platform for building line-of-business apps. The new addition to PowerApps in this release is the expansion of the Common Data Service, now called Common Data Service which now contains the core functionality of the Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement platform that powers Dynamics 365 for Sales, Marketing, Customer Service.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are already experienced with the Dynamics 365 for Sales, Marketing, or Customer Service apps, you will find that you will be able to apply your experience to customize and extend Common Data Service.
