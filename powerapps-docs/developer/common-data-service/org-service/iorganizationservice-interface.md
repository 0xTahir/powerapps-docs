# IOrganizationService Interface

<!-- 
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/developer/org-service/organization-service-methods 

The focus of this topic must change. Instead of just being a list of the methods in the interface, this topic should also

call out the  classes we ship that implement this interface, such as OrganizationServiceProxy and CrmServiceClient, etc.


Something else to consider:
    Since we seem to have spun up so many different classes that implement this interface, are there any scenarios where an ISV would do the same?

    Is this an example?
