# Entity Operations using the Organization service

<!-- 

This new topic will be the Organization service version of the Web API topic

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/developer/webapi/perform-operations-web-api

OR it may just be a TOC node?

I think there is some value in having a single URL addressable link to this topic

Needs to have something to say.
