Was Mike Carter

New page specifically about how to use Org service to perform these tasks.

All concepts that apply to both Web API and Organization service should be presented at a higher level: 
powerapps-docs/developer/common-data-service/detect-duplicate-data-for-developers.md

Keep in mind that examples for create and update operations are in :
powerapps-docs/developer/common-data-service/org-service/entity-operations-create.md#check-for-duplicate-records
