# Perform Conditional operations using the Organization Service

<!-- 

This is a proposed org-service version of the Web API topic

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/developer/webapi/perform-conditional-operations-using-web-api

Anything that uses rowversion as a condition the way the Web API uses ETags

Not sure these are enabled for organization service?
 - conditional retrieval: 
 - Limit upsert operations

If not, we can call out that these are unique to the Web API.

But we have an example about this in entity-operations-update-delete.md
 - Apply optimistic concurrency

 -->
