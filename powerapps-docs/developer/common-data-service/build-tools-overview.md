# PowerApps build tools overview

Use PowerApps Build Tools to automate common build and deployment tasks related to PowerApps . This includes synchronization of solution metadata (a.k.a. solutions) between development environments and source control, generating build artifacts, deploying to downstream environments, provisioning or de-provisioning of environments, and the ability to perform static analysis checks against your solution using the PowerApps checker service.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> PowerApps Build tools currently support end-to-end ALM for PowerApps and Dynamics 365 CE only, as some Environment Actions are not yet available for non-CRM Environments  
  
## What are PowerApps build tools

The PowerApps build tools are a collection of PowerApps specific Azure DevOps build tasks that eliminate the need to manually download for custom tooling  and scripts to manage the development of PowerApps. The tasks can be used individually to perform a simple task, such as importing a solution into a downstream environment, or used together in a pipeline to orchestrate a scenario, such as ‘Generate Build Artifact,’ ‘Deploy to Test,’ or ‘Harvest Maker Changes.’ The build tasks can largely be categorized into four types:

- Helper task  
- Solution tasks
- Publish customizations
- Environment management tasks
