When you build a client application you need to provide a way for people to connect to the Common Data Service for Apps instance they want to connect to. People may have access to multiple instances and they probably have not memorized the URL they need to connect to. With a discovery service you can provide a way to discover which instances are available for them to access and provide a means in your client for them to choose the instance. Using only their account credentials, your client application will provide UI for the user to choose from the instance available to them. Your client application can then use their choice to get information necessary to connect to that instance.

With CDS for Apps, server and organization allocation may change as part of datacenter management and load balancing. Therefore, a discovery service provides a way to discover which server is serving an instance at a given time.
