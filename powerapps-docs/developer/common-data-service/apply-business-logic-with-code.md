# Apply business logic with code

Whenever possible, you should first look to applying one of several declarative process options when a requirement involves defining business logic. See [Common Data Service for Apps Customization Guide: Create custom business logic through processes](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/customize/guide-staff-through-common-tasks-processes)

When a declarative process doesnâ€™t meet a requirement, as a developer you have several options. This topic will introduce common options to write code.

## Create a workflow extension

You can write a .NET assembly to provide new options within the process designer. This method provides a new option for people using the workflow designer to apply a condition or perform a new action. A workflow extension can then be re-used by people who are not developers to apply the logic in your code.

More information: [Custom workflow activities (workflow assemblies)](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/developer/custom-workflow-activities-workflow-assemblies)

## Create a plug-in

You can write a .NET assembly to plug-in to the data transaction flow to apply business logic on the server. With Common Data Service for Apps there is a framework you use to register specific events to execute code defined within a class in an assembly. That class inherits a specific interface that exposes an [Execute method](/dotnet/api/microsoft.xrm.sdk.iplugin.execute). When the registered event occurs, the `Execute` method on the class is invoked and passed contextual data about the event.

You will use the *Plug-in Registration Tool* to register your assemblies.

Within the `Execute` method, you can use the object model defined within the SDK Assemblies to evaluate the contextual event data and perform appropriate actions to do the following:
- Determine whether to cancel the operation by throwing an error
- Make changes to the contextual data passed to the Execute method
- Perform additional operations to automate processes using the Organization Service.

### Synchronous and asynchronous plug-ins
Plug-ins can be registered to execute synchronously within the transaction or to be deferred and sent to a queue that will apply the logic at a time that will have less impact on the server. For this reason, asynchronous plug-ins are preferred.

When you register the plugin to run synchronously for an event, you have options about when the code should run. There are three stages:

|Event  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Pre-validation|Occurs before the database transaction begins. This is a good place to apply business logic to determine whether the operation should be cancelled before the transaction begins to avoid the performance penalty of rolling back the transaction.|
|Pre-operation|Occurs after the database transaction has started. Cancelling an operation at this stage must roll back the transaction|
|Post-operation|Occurs within the database transaction after the main data operation is completed. Includes any changes which may have been applied in earlier events but incurs an even larger penalty when cancelling the operation.|

> [!NOTE]
> Synchronous plug-ins have constraints on the amount of system resources they can use. If a plug-in exceeds thresholds or becomes unresponsive an exception will be thrown cancelling the operation.
