# BusinessUnit entity

<!-- https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/customer-engagement/developer/businessunit-entity 
I've put this in the concepts area of the TOC next to security model.

Don't particularly feel that this requires a separate topic, but if it does it is around the idea that security roles are associated with a business unit, a point not mentioned in the current topic at all.

Check the Admin content to see if this entity is mentioned, perhaps just fold this topic into the Security Model topic.
