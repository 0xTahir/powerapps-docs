# Debug a custom workflow activity

<!-- TODO:
This content is about debugging on the server and won't work for Common Data Service for Apps.
See https://community.dynamics.com/crm/b/microsoftdynamicscrmandstuff/archive/2013/03/08/debugging-workflow-custom-activities-with-plugin-registration-tool

Maybe this was supposed to refer to this:
[Analyze plug-in performance](../analyze-plugin-performance.md)
or
[Debug a plug-In](../debug-plugin.md)

To debug a custom workflow activity, copy the .pdb file for the assembly to the `%installdir%\server\bin\assembly` folder. The assembly can be deployed as on-disk or stored in the database. The recommended deployment is in the database, but for debugging you should select on-disk. Next, attach the debugger to the `CrmAsyncService.exe` process. Make sure that you remove the .pdb file when youâ€™ve finished debugging because it uses memory to have it loaded. For detailed information, see [Debug a plug-In](../debug-plugin.md).   -->
