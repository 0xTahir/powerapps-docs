## Jan. 5
* Act on data right from your Power BI report or dashboard by integrating a [PowerApps custom visual (preview release)](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/blog/powerbi-powerapps-visual/), which pulls contextual data from your Power BI report.

## Dec. 8
1. [Condition templates](working-with-rules.md) for rules infer common properties of a control (such as **Text** or **Value**).

1. After you [save an app](save-publish-app.md) for the first time, additional changes are saved every two minutes automatically by default.
2. Easily [create rules](working-with-rules.md) for conditional formatting without writing expressions - just set your condition and then design the results right on the PowerApps canvas.
3. More easily configure forms, galleries, and data tables with a full-height data pane that pops out when a control is added.
4. Get contextual quick-tips to help you create an app, whether starting from a blank app, a template, a data source, or SharePoint.

## Sept. 6
1. For apps that you create, [track usage](app-analytics.md) in an embedded dashboard from Power BI.
