[**Items**](../maker/canvas-apps/controls/properties-core.md) The source of data that appears in a control such as a gallery, a list, or a chart.

<p style="margin-left: 2.0em">When you add a gallery, a list, or a chart, the property list shows <strong>Items</strong> by default so that you can easily specify the data that the new control should show. For example, you might set the <strong>Items</strong> property of a gallery to the <strong>Account</strong> table in Salesforce, a table named <strong>Inventory</strong> that you created in Excel and uploaded to the cloud, or a SharePoint list named <strong>ConferenceSpeakers</strong>.
