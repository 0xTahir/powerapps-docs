Fields of the record currently being processed are available within the formula.  Use the [**ThisRecord** operator](../maker/canvas-apps/functions/operators.md#thisitem-thisrecord-and-as-operators) or simply reference fields by name as you would any other value.  You can also reference control properties and other values from throughout your app.  For more details, see the examples below and [working with record scope](../maker/canvas-apps/working-with-tables.md#record-scope).
