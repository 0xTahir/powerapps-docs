# Power Platform Patterns

With Power Platform, you can easily create apps that are tailored to your
organization’s specific needs.  While your needs might be unique, we see some
common *patterns* among apps most often created by organizations to meet their
most-pressing needs.

Different scenarios, across different industries, often use the basic same
patterns.  For example, an app for doing aircraft inspections, a health
pre-registration questionnaire, and an app for tracking kids’ reading levels all
have a similar structure, even though they have very different purposes and
audiences.

In this set of articles, we’ve identified some of the uses for Power Platform
we’ve seen and the patterns that successful makers have used to bring these
solutions to life. Each Pattern article contains links to the real-world
customer stories that include best practices for structuring data, using the
elements of Power Platform, and integrating into the overall business. 

In the list below, look for a scenario that is similar to what you need, then
select the pattern to learn more.

We’ll continue to add patterns over time.
