Planning Phase
==============

Planning is the most important part of the app making process. When planning,
you should consider the following:

-   **What** problem will the app solve?

-   **Who** will use this app?

-   **What** goals and objectives will it meet for the users?

This ensures you have all the necessary information to design the app. What
goals the app will achieve is the most important part of this planning phase,
because it is easy to fall into *making the app* as the objective, rather than
*solving the issue* itself.

In this section, you’ll learn about:

-   Identifying the business problem to solve (the use case)

-   Deeply understanding the business process

-   Optimizing the business process with your solution

-   Deciding if it’s worthwhile to automate the process

-   Creating a project plan
