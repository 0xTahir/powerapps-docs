# Planning Phase

Planning is the most important part of the app making process. When planning,
you should consider the following:

-   **What** problem will the app solve?

-   **Who** will use this app?

-   **What** goals and objectives will it meet for the users?

Knowing the answers helps you stay on track when you design the app. It's easy to fall into the trap of *making the app* as the objective, rather than
*solving the issue*.

In this section, you’ll learn about:

-   [Identifying the business problem to solve (the use case)](identifying-business-problem-to-solve.md)

-   [Deeply understanding the business process](understanding-current-business-process.md)

-   [Optimizing the business process with your solution](optimizing-business-process.md)

-   [Deciding if it’s worthwhile to automate the process](worth-automating-process.md)

-   [Creating a project plan](creating-project-plan.md)
