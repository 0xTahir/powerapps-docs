Planning Phase
==============

Planning is the most important part of the app making process. When planning,
you should consider the following:

-   **What** problem will the app solve?

-   **Who** will use this app?

-   **What** goals and objectives will it meet for the users?

Knowing the answers helps you stay on track when you design the app. It's easy to fall into the trap of *making the app* as the objective, rather than
*solving the issue*.

In this section, you’ll learn about:

-   Identifying the business problem to solve (the use case)

-   Deeply understanding the business process

-   Optimizing the business process with your solution

-   Deciding if it’s worthwhile to automate the process

-   Creating a project plan
