Designing Phase
===============

Designing the app is an important part of the process where you will start to
specify what you will be creating in the making phase based on the information
you have gathered in the Planning phase.

In this phase, you will prepare the specifications and designs of your app.

Conceptual design 
------------------

Conceptual design is about coming up with the design for the overall blueprint
of the app.

In this section, youâ€™ll consider:

-   [What are the tasks involved in the app?](app-tasks.md)

-   [What will the user experience be?](sketching.md)

Architectural design 
---------------------

Once you have completed your conceptual design, it is time to move on to the
architectural design. The architecture design specifies how you will use Power
Apps (and other Power platform products) to automate your business process.

This is where you will consider things like:

- [How to store your data](where-is-data.md)

- [How to integrate with existing systems and apps you use already](enterprise-systems.md)

- [Determining which type of app to make](app-type.md)

- [Determining where to place your logic](logic.md)

- [How to secure your data](security.md)
