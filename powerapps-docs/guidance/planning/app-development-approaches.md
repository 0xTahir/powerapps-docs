# Differences between Power Apps and traditional app development approaches


Compared to traditional app development, Power Apps projects have differences in
two areas:

-   How various members of the organization work together to create the solution

-   Development methodology

## Differences in who develops

Power Apps is a platform that benefits both “pro developers” and “citizen
developers.”

In a traditional development, only pro developers could be involved with the
actual making of an app. With Power Apps, it gives everyone the power to build
the apps they need with advanced functionality previously available only to
professional developers. Power Apps "democratizes" the custom business app
building experience by enabling users to build feature-rich, custom business
apps without writing code.

## Differences in development methodology

With traditional app development such as “waterfall,” there is a long lead time
until a user actually “sees” a working app. As a result, it increases the risk
of gaps between what the user has initially requested as a requirement and what
the app developer has created.

Even with more modern development approaches such as agile development, there
can be significant time before the first “minimum viable product” (MVP) is
delivered to users.

With Power Apps, you can quickly create a usable version of your app, because
Power Apps provides a WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) development
experience. Users experience the actual working app very early in the
development process, and if new requirements arise, new features can be added to
the next version.
