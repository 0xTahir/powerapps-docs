Documenting the business process
================================

For each part of the business process, understand the following aspects:

-   What is the task?

-   Who is doing the work?

-   Where and with what tools are they doing the work?

-   What steps are they doing?

-   What data do they need?

-   What data do they create or change?

-   What decisions are made?

-   How does this task pass to the next task?

In each step, weâ€™ll provide an example from our example project: Expense
Reporting.
