# Making Phase

You have now planned and designed your app. The next step is to actually make
the app.

> [!TIP]
> In addition to the links below, you’ll find a curated collection of
learning resources here: <https://aka.ms/PowerPlatformResources>.

## Basic steps for making Canvas Apps


Below are the basic steps when creating canvas apps.

1.  Set up the data source

    -   [Set up
        entities](../../maker/common-data-service/create-edit-entities.md)
        (when using Common Data Service)

    -   Set up tables (when using a database)

    -   [Set up
        lists](https://support.office.com/article/create-a-list-in-sharepoint-0d397414-d95f-41eb-addd-5e6eff41b083)
        (when using SharePoint)

2.  [Create a new
    app](../../maker/canvas-apps/getting-started#build-an-app.md)

3.  [Add
    connectors](../../maker/canvas-apps/add-manage-connections.md)

4.  [Create
    screens](../../maker/canvas-apps/add-screen-context-variables)

    -   Home Screen

    -   List View

    -   View form

    -   Edit form

5.  [Create Power Automate
    flows](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-automate/get-started-logic-flow)

## Basic steps for making Model-driven Apps

Below are the basic steps when creating Model-driven apps. If you are unfamiliar
with the components, you should have a look at [Understand model-driven app
components](../../maker/model-driven-apps/model-driven-app-components.md).

1.  Create a
    [Solution](../../maker/model-driven-apps/distribute-model-driven-app.md)

2.  Set up data models by defining
    [Entities](../../maker/common-data-service/entity-overview.md)
    and
    [Fields](../../maker/common-data-service/fields-overview.md)

3.  Set up [Security
    models](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/security-roles-privileges)

4.  Create a Sitemap by setting up a new [Model-driven
    app](../../maker/model-driven-apps/build-first-model-driven-app.md)

5.  Customize
    [Forms](../../maker/model-driven-apps/create-design-forms.md)
    and
    [Views](../../maker/model-driven-apps/create-edit-views.md)

6.  Set up [Business Process
    Flows](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-automate/business-process-flows-overview)

7.  Setup [Business
    Rules](../../maker/model-driven-apps/create-business-rules-recommendations-apply-logic-form.md)

8.  Set up [Power Automate
    flows](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-automate/connection-cds)

## Developing solutions collaboratively

When developing your solutions with multiple app makers, there are ways of
collaborating depending on which application type you are making.

### Canvas Apps

You can develop canvas apps collaboratively by using [Power Apps
components](../../maker/canvas-apps/create-component.md)
— a reusable set of building blocks — and also component libraries — a
repository that allows you to share and collaborate with others on Power Apps
components you have created. Have a look at the blog post about [Collaborative
development for Canvas
Apps](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/blog/collaborative-development-for-powerapps-canvas-apps/)
for further information.

### Model-driven Apps

When developing model-driven apps, consider using solutions and
environments designated for multiple app makers. This document has detailed
explanation on the strategies for development.
