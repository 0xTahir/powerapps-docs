## Basic steps for making Model-driven Apps

Below are the basic steps when creating Model-driven apps. If you are unfamiliar
with the components, you should have a look at [Understand model-driven app
components](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/model-driven-app-components).

1.  Create a
    [Solution](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/distribute-model-driven-app)

2.  Set up data models by defining
    [Entities](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/entity-overview)
    and
    [Fields](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/fields-overview)

3.  Set up [Security
    models](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/admin/security-roles-privileges)

4.  Create a Sitemap by setting up a new [Model-driven
    app](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/build-first-model-driven-app)

5.  Customize
    [Forms](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/create-design-forms)
    and

    Rules](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/create-business-rules-recommendations-apply-logic-form)

8.  Set up [Power Automate
    flows](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-automate/connection-cds)

## Developing solutions collaboratively

When developing your solutions with multiple app makers, there are ways of
collaborating depending on which application type you are making.

### Canvas Apps

You can develop canvas apps collaboratively by using [Power Apps
components](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/create-component)
— a reusable set of building blocks — and also component libraries — a
repository that allows you to share and collaborate with others on Power Apps
components you have created. Have a look at the blog post about [Collaborative
development for Canvas
Apps](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/blog/collaborative-development-for-powerapps-canvas-apps/)
for further information.

### Model-driven Apps

When developing model-driven apps, consider using solutions and
environments designated for multiple app makers. This document has detailed
explanation on the strategies for development.
