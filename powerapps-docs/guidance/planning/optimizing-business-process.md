# Optimizing your business process

Now that you've inspected the entire business process, challenge yourself to
optimize the process. Streamlining the process avoids having so many steps that it
is overwhelming or confusing to the employees​.

Some helpful ways to approach optimizing the process:

- Start with the goal: Identify the goals you would like to achieve with your
    business process. These goals should provide a general vision of your hopes for the future
    process.

- Consider whether something can be completed more efficiently, more cheaply
    or with higher quality.

- Look for key performance indicators to identify what is functioning well and
    what needs work toward improvement.

- Step back and get an outside eye by sharing the process with your team​.

- Share the process with management to get a higher-level perspective and
    provide transparent accountability for each step within the process. ​

- Look at your process from the point of view of the user or customer who may
    benefit from the process and consider ways you can improve their experience
    and overall satisfaction​.

Some key questions to ask:

- Are there any remaining activities which could be cut from the process to
    increase efficiency or quality, or decrease cost?

- If the cut activity is important to the overall business, can it be
        handled in a separate business process​?

- Can a step be improved to accomplish your objective in a better way?​

- Can the order of steps be rearranged?

- Can steps be combined?

- Can steps in this process be run concurrently?

- Can you reduce the number of people it takes to execute the process?

- Can you change how you notify the next person in the process so that they
    respond more quickly?

- Are there aspects of the process you can further automate?

  - Capturing data automatically verus manual entry

  - Automate decisions based on data?

  - Automate the action taken?

  - [Use AI](https://docs.microsoft.com/ai-builder/overview) to replace
        human attention?

## Example: Optimizing the expense report process

We reviewed the current expense process and there were some obvious improvements
to make:
<!--Should this be bulleted also? SELF-->
1. Go paperless for entire process. (We noted the savings and environmental
    impact as a project benefit as well.)

2. Do all possible compliance checks before enabling submission of the report
    for approval. (Greatly reduces rework and end-to-end process time.)

3. Automatically look up and add accounting codes when expense report is
    submitted.

4. Enable Accounting to move the approved expenses to the financial system
    without re-entering any data.

5. Create weekly expense reports automatically from the digital data.

Charlotte is considering further optimizations of the budget review process. And
Rebecca is researching ways the semi-annual audit can be optimized with AI.

Our proposed optimized process looks like this:
