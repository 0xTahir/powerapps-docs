# Visually map the process

The next step is to draw the business process of the use case you're trying to
solve.

> [!TIP]
> You can draw your map on paper or with a tool such as Visio or PowerPoint.

This business process should include not only the steps that directly relate to
the app you're trying to create but also the steps before and after,
to see how the app fits into the overall business process.

Use your map to reconfirm with your team that you’ve captured the business
process accurately.

Here’s an example business process map:

List each activity in order and link it to the next part of the process​:

1. Start with the first event leading to your goal

2. Draw a line to a box – fill this box with the first activity required to
    work from this event to your goal​.

3. When you reach a point that requires a decision, draw a diamond around the
    question that must be answered.  Usually this is written as a true/false
    question. Two lines should proceed from the diamond leading to the activity
    that's done based<!--"that occurs depending on the decision? SELF--> on the decision – one line is for ‘true’ the other is for
    ‘false’.​

4. Link each activity sequentially – some may run simultaneously through
    different departments within your business​.

5. Culminate in the activity which reaches your goal. ​

You can also add data to your map, such as time taken or cost of the task. Then,
you’ll be able to compare and gain insights to which areas need improvement. You
can also use this for comparing the money or time saved by the new process.
