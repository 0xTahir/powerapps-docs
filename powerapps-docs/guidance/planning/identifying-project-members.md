Identifying the project members
===============================

Anyone who is involved when designing, making, and testing the apps will be a
project member.

The list of key contributors you made is a starting point, and you may need to
add expertise to the team, whether it’s someone who has experience making Power
Apps apps or Power Automate flows, or a software developer to help create
connections to existing databases.

As Power Apps provides development/making capabilities for everyone, it is
important to coordinate and collaborate between the different teams for smooth
app development.

Consider these roles:

-   End users / subject matter experts

>   Provide the necessary requirements and feedback to ensure the created apps
>   meet their requested requirements.

-   App makers

>   Use Power Apps to make apps for end users. For simple apps, the end user may
>   be the app maker. Some organizations have dedicated app makers who are
>   experts in building Power Apps for others.

-   Software developers (if needed)

>   Provide solutions that cannot be solved using “out of the box” features,
>   when the requirements are complex and need custom development. Developers
>   can also create APIs and set up custom connectors to allow app makers to
>   consume those APIs.

-   IT administrators

>   Provide necessary resources and support to connect to internal systems as
>   well as enterprise systems. IT administrators ensure environments and
>   tenants are set up for governance and administration. Some organizations
>   have a [Center of
>   Excellence](https://docs.microsoft.com/ja-jp/power-platform/guidance/coe/starter-kit)
>   for scalable adoption of the platform.

-   Project manager

>   Manages the project to help ensure it stays on track for scope, budget,
>   time, and meeting the goals you set out.

-   Management

>   Provides sponsorship and shows support of the activities and projects
>   related to the platform

-   Empowers the project members

-   Ratifies the project objectives

-   Communicates support to the organization to aid adoption

-   Makes sure that the accomplishments are recognized

>   A larger project may also require a technical architect, UI design,
>   documentation, training, or other roles.

>   For a small project, one person may be the subject matter expert, manage the
>   project, and make the app.
