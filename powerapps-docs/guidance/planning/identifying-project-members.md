# Identifying the project members

Anyone who is involved when designing, making, and testing the apps will be a
project member.

The [list of key contributors](understanding-current-business-process.md) you made is a starting point. You may need to
add expertise to the team, whether it’s someone who has experience making Power
Apps apps or Power Automate flows, or a software developer to help create
connections to existing databases.

Power Apps provides app making capabilities for everyone, so it's
important to coordinate and collaborate for smooth
app development. (In the [Making phase](making-phase.md) we discuss strategies for collaboration.)

Consider these roles:

| Team member                | Role     |
|----------------------------|----------|
| End users / subject matter experts | Provide the necessary requirements and feedback to ensure the created apps meet their requested requirements.   |
| App makers                         | Use Power Apps to make apps for end users. For simple apps, the end user may be the app maker. Some organizations have dedicated app makers who are experts in building Power Apps for others.  |
| Software developers    | Provide solutions that can't be solved using “out of the box” features, when the requirements are complex and need custom development. Developers can also create APIs and set up custom connectors to allow app makers to consume those APIs.    |
| IT administrators                  | Provide necessary resources and support to connect to internal systems as well as enterprise systems. IT administrators ensure environments and tenants are set up for governance and administration. Some organizations have a [Center of Excellence](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/guidance/coe/starter-kit) for scalable adoption of the platform. |
| Project manager                    | Manages the project to help ensure it stays on track for scope, budget, time, and meeting the goals you set out.      |
| Management                         | Provides sponsorship and shows support of the activities and projects related to the platform: Empowers the project members; Ratifies the project objectives; Communicates support to the organization to aid adoption; Makes sure that the accomplishments are recognized   |

A larger project may also require a technical architect, UI design,
documentation, training, or other roles.

For a small project, one person may be the subject matter expert, manage the
project, and make the app.
