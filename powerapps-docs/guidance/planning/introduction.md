# Introduction: Planning a Power Apps project


If you just started using Power Apps, it may be a little overwhelming trying to
create an app from a blank screen.

You may have some idea in your mind but have not fully thought through all the
details and information you need in order to create an app. You may be a
business user or IT Pro who has never designed or built an app before. Or you
may be a pro developer who wants to know what is different from traditional app
development.

In these articles, regardless of your background or how much you know about app
development, you'll learn about the steps to convert your ideas into a fully
working solution using Power Apps.

The basics of making a Power Apps app are as follows:

1. [**Plan**](planning-phase.md): Identify the who, what, when & why

2. [**Design**](planning-phase.md): Model the data (decide how the data you need and create will be
    organized, accessed and stored) and sketch out the app screens

3. [**Make**](making-phase.md): Create the app

4. [**Test**](testing-phase.md): Try the app with users

5. [**Deploy and Refine**](refining-phase.md): Get your app into the hands of users, get feedback,
    and decide what to change or add

In this set of articles, you will learn about each of these steps in detail.
We’ve included a detailed example to help clarify the concepts.

If you are a **business person**, these articles are intended to help you plan
and execute what may be your first app project.

- The Planning section should help you whether you’re planning to build an app
    yourself or creating requirements to pass along to another app maker. You’ll
    be very familiar with many of the Planning steps and some may be new to you.

- The Design \> Conceptual Design section will help you begin to turn your
    business process into the screens and features of an app.

- If you’re going to make your own app, we’ve tried to make the Design \>
    Architectural Design, Making, Testing, and Refining sections easy to follow
    for new app makers.

If you’re a **dedicated app maker** who isn’t an expert in the business process,
these articles are for you, too.

- Follow the Planning steps while interviewing your future app users to help
    you deeply understand the business process.

- The Design, Making, Testing, and Refining sections all include Power
    Apps-specific information to help make your project successful.

If you are a **“full stack” developer**, this methodology will cover projects
more suited for rapid development vs the traditional large-scale development.

recommended guide to use.
