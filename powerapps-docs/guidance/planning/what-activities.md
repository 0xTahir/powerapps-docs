# What activities are being performed in this step?

Write down the activities that the user is doing to complete the tasks in this
step of the business process. Get into the details of the activities.

When deciding on the activities, it is useful to consider cause and effect of
each activity, how they relate to each other and how they move you closer to
your desired objective.  Identify the starting point of the process and fill in
the activities leading to the objective. ​

Activities can be sequential or parallel, meaning either one
activity cannot occur until the other is completed or two activities can occur
at the same time within the process​.

## Example: Filling out an expense report

When we spoke to Lee, Shawna, and Rebecca, they told us the steps were:

1.  Decide to file expense report. Sometimes this is at end of week or month,
    sometimes it is upon return from a trip, sometimes it is as soon as the
    receipt is available.

2.  Find a blank copy of or print the expense report form.

3.  Enter personal information (name, employee ID etc.) and expense purpose.

4.  Gather receipts to get expense info from (and turn in if needed).

5.  Fill out item details.

6.  Figure out expense categories and which expenses need extra detail. (Often
    look up this information in Expense Reporting manual.)

7.  If travel-related, list *per diem* the company already paid, if any.

8.  Calculate subtotals and totals.

9.  Figure out which receipts need to be attached and paperclip them to the
    report form. Often keep their own copy (photo or photocopy).

10. Get the form and receipts to manager (either by walking to desk,
    inter-office mail, or postal mail).
