Listing the project tasks and owners
====================================

Based on the five project phases (Plan, Design, Make, Test, Deploy and refine),
list out the tasks that needs to be done at each phase. Assign who will be
responsible for each task along with the targeted date of completion.

You may want to use Microsoft Planner to manage your tasks together with your
project team.

See [Developing solutions collaboratively](making-phase.md) for information about how to enable
multiple people to build one Power Apps project.
