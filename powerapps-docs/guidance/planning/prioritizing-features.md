Prioritizing features and requests
==================================

Prioritizing different requests can sometimes be difficult and intimidating.
Following a relatively quantifiable approach will not only help you prioritize
the correct features first, but also help you explain your decisions to the
people who requested the features.

The first step of prioritizing features is to make sure to record every request,
even requests that you may feel that are unimportant. This will help you create
a backlog for improvement when you start working on making new versions of your
app after you finished your first version.

> [!TIP]
> Use your project goals as a guide to what features need to be prioritized.


The table below shows an example of how you could record each feature.

|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Feature requested**                                                                 | **Absolute necessity?** | **Difficulty of implementation** | **Impact to Business** |

| Real-time push notification to user on their mobile when approval request is received | No                      | Easy                             | High                   |
| Draft save feature for non-submitted expense applications                             | No                      | Hard                             | Medium                 |
| Integrate with ERP system                                                             | No                      | Hard                             | Very High              |

> [!TIP]
> Avoid mixing up *necessities* with *nice to haves.* Ask yourself (or your
    users): “If this feature takes 4 weeks to add, is it worth delaying launch
    by 4 weeks?”

Priority Quadrant
-----------------

Once you have listed all your feature requests, you should triage the requests
into the quadrant below.

![Priority quadrant with an axis for low to high impact and an axis for low to high effort](media/priority-quadrant.png)

### Quick Wins

The requests in this category should be prioritized **first**. Quick Wins are
requests that have high impact to the business, yet are easy to implement.

### Big Investments

These requests provide high impact to the business but are also difficult to
implement due to one or more reasons below:

-   Additional investment is required (such as a new service)

-   Requires development by pro-developers or external business partner

-   Takes a long time (more than a week) to create the feature

-   Involves multiple stakeholders across different departments

### Little Satisfiers

This type of request can be easy to implement but only provides limited impact
to the business. You should prioritize Quick Wins and Big Investments first
before you start working on Little Satisfiers. Be careful not to be too heavily
into these Little Satisfiers, as working on too many of these will in turn into
a Big Investment.

### Time Consumers

Time Consumers take up a lot of time but provide a little impact. These may come
from management who don’t directly use the app. When facing these situations,
you can share the idea of Priority Quadrant to explain how the decisions were
made. You may help them understand, or you may learn that something is more
impactful than you thought.

> [!TIP]
> Have users requesting the features review (or even create!) this Priority
Quadrant for mutual understanding.
