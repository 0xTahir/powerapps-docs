How does this task pass to the next task?
=========================================

Now it is time to move to the next task in the process. What does that look
like?

Does it build on the data that is used by this task? Are there different next
tasks depending on different data? (For example, an extra layer of approval for
expense reports over \$500.)

Is the next task performed by the same person who completed this task? Is the
next task completed by a different person? How does that person know that they
can begin the next task?

On to the next task!
--------------------

Now that this task has been inspected, continue with the next task in the
process starting back at What is the task? until all of the tasks have been
inspected.
