# Sketching the screens

After you've identified the tasks and your thoughts are organized, the next
step is to sketch the screens you envision needing within your app. By drawing
out each task and the business process, you already have enough information
about how to get from point A to point B. Sketching the screens will allow you
to visualize the journey.

Don’t be intimidated by the sketching. You don’t have to be an artist to throw a
few boxes and lines on some paper. To avoid getting into too much detail, use
boxes to represent icons and images, and use lines to represent text. You could
use a tool like PowerPoint to efficiently draw the sketch as well.

> [!TIP]
> Focus more on the overall flow of the business rather than the details on
screen. Power Apps allows you to easily adjust later.

Note that you don’t have to be restrictive and draw just one version of the
sketch. Try out drawing different versions of the screen. Keep sketching until
you run out of ideas.

A good way to get ideas of each screen is to look at the apps you normally use
and “borrow” the ideas. These apps are often created by professional designers.
We also provide [customer

and samples of apps in [Power Apps
community](https://powerusers.microsoft.com/t5/Power-Apps-Community/ct-p/PowerApps1)
that you could look into. Trying out app templates also shows great variety of
different styles of apps too.

Check with the actual user to see if the sketches match with their
expectations. Showing the sketches you drew and sharing the
idea with the user will also eliminate any differences in expectations. Ideally,
use the sketches as a “paper prototype” and have your user pretend to actually
use it.
