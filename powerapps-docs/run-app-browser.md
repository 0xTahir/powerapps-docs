# Quickstart: Run an app in a web browser
When you create a canvas-driven or model-driven app, or an app creator shares an app with you, you can run that app in a web browser from the [Dynamics 365](https://home.dynamics.com) Home page, or you can run it on a mobile device. In this quickstart, you'll learn how to run an app in a web browser.

## Prerequisites
To follow this quickstart, you need a Microsoft Office 365 account that includes a Dynamics 365 subscription, and you need access to one of the following supported browsers and operating systems:

| **Browser** | **Operating system** |
| --- | --- |
| Google Chrome (latest version)<br>(recommended) |Windows 7 SP1, 8.1, and 10 <br>macOS <br>iOS 8 or later<br>Android |
| Microsoft Edge (latest version)<br>(recommended) |Windows 10 |
| Microsoft Internet Explorer 11 (with Compatibility View off) |Windows 7 SP1, 8.1, and 10 |
| Mozilla Firefox (latest version) |Windows 7 SP1, 8.1, and 10 <br> Android <br>macOS |
| Apple Safari (latest version) |macOS <br> iOS 8 or later |

## Sign in to Dynamics 365
Sign in to Dynamics 365 at [https://home.dynamics.com]([https://home.dynamics.com).

## Find the app on the home page
The Home page may show several types of business apps, but you can find a specific app by typing part of its name in the search box. You can also filter the list to show only apps created by a specific source, such as PowerApps or Dynamics 365. To do this, click or tap **Filter** and then select the source.

If you've recently installed the app, it might not immediately appear in the list of apps. Click or tap **Sync** to show all of your apps. This process may take up to a minute.

## Run the app from the task pane
After you find the app, you can pin it to the task pane for easier access. To pin an app, click or tap the ellipsis (...) on the app tile, and then click or tap **Pin this app**.

To run the pinned app from the task pane, click or tap **Dynamics 365** in the upper-left corner, locate the app under **My apps**, and then click or tap it.

## Run an app from a URL
You can save the app's URL as a bookmark in your browser and run it by selecting the bookmark, or you can send the URL as a link through email. If someone else created an app and shared it with you in an email, you can run the app by clicking or tapping the link in the email. When running an app using a URL, you may be prompted to sign in using your Azure Active Directory credentials.

## Connect to data
If the app requires a connection to a data source or requires consent to use device capabilities, you'll be prompted before you use the app:  

![Connection](./media/run-app-browser/app-connection.png)

Typically, you're prompted only the first time.

## Close the app
To close the app, sign out of the Dynamics 365 Home page, or open another app.

## Next steps
In this quickstart, you learned how to run an app in a web browser. To learn how to run an app on a mobile device, continue to the next quickstart.
