# Share an app using entities

Sharing an app using entities is the same way as sharing an app that does not use entities, but there are some restrictions in the public preview.

To learn more about app sharing, see [Share an app](share-app.md).

## Share with "can use" or "can use and share" permission

You can share an app using entities with others without any limitation when the permission is either of the following:

* Can use
* Can use and share

You can share it with an individual or a group.

When you choose to share an app this way, everyone you shared the app with will be able to access and manage the data in the entities. They cannot manage the entities themselves.

## Share with "can edit" permission

You should only share "can edit" permission with others who are also authors of the app.

When you choose to share an app this way, all the approved users you shared the app with will be able to fully manage your database where all your entities are. They'll be able to modify all your entities, delete them, and even create new ones.

## Share with an entire organization

This is not available for entities in public preview.
