# Create an app in KratosApps Studio

Create a Windows app to manage organizational data (such as text, numbers, and images) without learning a programming language. Import one or more sets of data from sources such as Excel, SharePoint, an Azure mobile service, a REST source, or a social-media channel. Update the data to keep it current, and add records as your organization grows. Show data sets in tables, charts, or other ways that help your organization make better decisions.

Get an [overview](readme.md) of Project Siena, and check out [other sample apps](readme.md).

Create an app for tracking inventory by showing a picture of each product, its name, and the number of units in stock. As products are sold, update the quantity to reflect your current inventory.
