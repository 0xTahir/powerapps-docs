## Configure a control ##

	![A label surrounded by a selection box](./media/get-started-test-drive/selected-label.jpg)

	This element of the UI is called a label and, when you click it, it becomes selected. If an element is selected, a thick, gray box surrounds it, which indicates that you can change the way it looks or behaves.

	**Important:** If you click another element or a blank area of the screen, that element or screen becomes selected, and you can no longer configure the first element.

1. Change the text in the label by triple-clicking it and then typing in anything you want.
