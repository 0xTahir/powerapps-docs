# Create an app using tables

PowerApps data platform makes it easy to store data using both standard tables provided by the platform and custom tables created by your organization. After you have the tables you need, using them to create an app is really simple.

There are two ways to create an app using tables:

* Create from data
* Create from scratch

The PowerApps data platform is enabled automatically as a data connection so that tables then can be added as data sources to PowerApps. This is the same experience as external connections such as Microsoft SharePoint Online, Microsoft Dynamics CRM, or Salesforce.

## Create from data

The simplest way to create an app using tables takes just a few minutes:

1. Open PowerApps Studio and sign in with your organizational account.
2. Click **New** and then select **Start from your data**.
3. A list of connections appears for you to choose from. Select **PowerApps data platform** and then click **Connect**. The platform is available to you automatically. No additional sign-in is needed.
4. Select the table you want to use. Click **Connect** again.

The standard "create from data" experience will start. For more information, see [Create an app from a set of data](#get-started-create-from-data.md).

## Create from scratch

Starting from scratch gives you the most flexibility:

1. Open PowerApps Studio and login sign in with your organizational account.
2. Click **New** and then select **Start from scratch**. This will create an empty app.
3. Click **Content** and then **Data sources** on the ribbon to open the data sources pane on the right.
4. Click **Insert your data** to add a data source.
5. A list of connections appears for you to choose from. Select **PowerApps data platform** and then click **Connect**. The platform is available to you automatically. No additional sign-in is needed.
6. In the list of tables, select the one you want to use. Click **Connect** again.

A data source pointing to the selected table will be added to the app. You can then use it with controls and formulas.
