# Create an app using tables

PowerApps data platform makes it easy to store data using both standard tables provided by the platform and custom tables created by your organization. Once you have the tables you need, using them to create an app is really simple.

There are two ways to create an app using tables:

1. Create from data
2. Create from scratch

PowerApps data platform are enabled automatically as a data connection so taht tables then can be added as data sources to PowerApps. This is the same experience as external connections like SharePoint Online, Dynamics CRM or Salesforce.

## Create from data

This the simplest way to create an app using tables takes just a few minutes:

1. Open PowerApps Studio and login with your organizational account.
2. Click **New** and then select **Start from your data**.
3. A list of connections will show up for you to choose from. Select **PowerApps data platform** and click **Connect**. The platform is available to you automatically, no additional login is needed.
4. Select the table you want to use. Click **Connect** again.

The standard "create from data" experience will start. For more information, please refer to [Create an app from a set of data](#get-started-create-from-data.md).

## Create from scratch

Starting from scratch gives you the most flexibility:

1. Open PowerApps Studio and login with your organizational account.
2. Click **New** and then select **Start from scratch**. This will create an empty app.
3. Click **Content** and then **Data sources** in the ribbon to open the data sources pane on the right.
4. Click **Insert your data** to add a data source.
5. A list of connections will show up for you to choose from. Select **PowerApps data platform** and click **Connect**. The platform is available to you automatically, no additional login is needed.
6. From the list of tables, select the one you want to use. Click **Connect** again.

A data source pointing to the selected table will be added to the app. You then can use it with controls and formulas.
