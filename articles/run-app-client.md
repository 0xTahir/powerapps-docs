# Using PowerApps on phones and tablets #
PowerApps can run on Windows, iOS, Android, and in a web browser. Apps running on mobile can take advantage of the device capabilities, like location and a camera. You can download PowerApps for Android, and iOS from their respective app stores. 

## What you need to get started ##
- Either of the following:
	- An app that you built from a [template](get-started-test-drive.md), from [data](get-started-create-from-data.md), or from [scratch](get-started-create-from-blank.md).
	- An app that someone else built and shared with view permissions.
- PowerApps installed on iPhone, iPad, Windows or Android devices. Here are the specific versions supported:  
	- iOS versions 9 and above
	- Android versions 5 and above
	- Windows 8.1 and above

[Get started with PowerApps](getting-started.md) may be a good resource.

## Launch an app ##
To use apps on tablets and phones:

1. Launch the app by tapping on the app icon.
2. For apps that are shared with you, you get a notification. Select the notification to open the app.


## Give consent ##
If the app requires a connection to a data sources, or requires consent to use the device, you are prompted for the configuration before you use the app:  

![Connection](./media/run-app-client/app-connection.png)

Typically, you are only prompted the first time.

## Exit the app ##
From within the app, swipe the screen to the right to partially reveal the list of apps. Slide the screen to the right completely to exit the app:

## Share the app ##
App users that have the "can view and share" shared permissions can share the app with other users in your organization, even though they are not the author of the app. The share experience is the same as if the user is the author of the app. 

App authors can also share apps with the entire organization with a simple checkbox. Apps shared using this option have only "view" permissions:

[Sharing an app](share-app.md) provides more details on sharing.


## Pin the app to the home screen ##
Apps that have been downloaded and used at least once can be pinned to the device home screen for quick access. Tap on the **...** option for each app to access the **Pin** option. Follow the device-specific instructions to pin the app tile on your home screen:
