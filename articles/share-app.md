# Share an app#
You can share your app with co-workers so that they can use your app too! If you share an app with ‘view’ permissions, your co-worker may use the app; and if you share an app with ‘edit’ permissions, your co-worker may edit the app to make improvements to it and share the app with others.

**Prerequisites**
- PowerApps on iOS or Windows device
- An app that you have built from data or a template. For more information on how to build an app, look [here]().

You may share an app from

1. If you’d like your co-worker to use the app but not edit it, share the app with ‘Can View’ permissions.

	If you’d like your co-worker to help make changes to the app, share the app with ‘Can Edit’ permissions. Co-workers who have ‘Can Edit’ permissions on your app will be able to share it on further with other co-workers.

	On the **web**, permissions can be selected next to your co-worker’s name:

	Make sure to click on ‘Save’ to share the app with your co-worker.

	In PowerApps, permissions can be selected right below your co-worker’s name:

	Make sure to click on Share to share the app with your co-worker.

1.	Your co-worker will now get an email indicating that an app was shared by you. All your co-worker has to do is to click the link in the email to access the app. If your co-worker doesn’t have PowerApps or isn’t signed up to use it, he/she will be taken through the process to download PowerApps and sign up for it.

	![Message that notifies user of shared app](./media/share-app/mail-notification.png)

1.	You may share an app with multiple co-workers at the same time, or with an AD group. When you share an app with an AD group, the permissions that you assign to the group will apply to all the users in the AD group. If a user is added to the AD group, he/she will be able to access the app with the assigned permissions. If a user is deleted from the AD group, he/she will no longer have access to the app.

1. You may revoke a user’s access to the app by clicking on the ‘X’ next to his/her name in the Share dialog on the web.
