# Generate an app from the SharePoint Online list interface

[AZURE.VIDEO nb:cid:UUID:639d7eaf-bae5-447c-a34b-ec539a01a15c]

In a SharePoint Online list, generate a three-screen app that manages the list.

You can **Create an app** using PowerApps from the command bar of any SharePoint Online custom list. Apps generated through this flow show up as views within the new SharePoint modern list experience.  This allows you to leverage PowerApps to build custom, mobile-optimized views of your existing lists and share them with your co-workers.  Since PowerApps is a cross-platform service, you can run the apps you generate across all of your devices including Windows, iOS, Android, and the web browser.

As of this writing, PowerApps supports custom lists but not libraries. In addition, you can show data in some types of columns, such as **Choice** and **Picture**, but you can't update that data. For more information, see [Known issues](connection-sharepoint-online.md#known-issues).

## Prerequisites

If you're unfamiliar with PowerApps, see [Introduction to PowerApps](getting-started.md).

## Generate a new app

1. Open your SharePoint Online list.

2. Select **PowerApps** and then **Create an app** to open a panel in SharePoint that allows you to enter a name for your app and start the app creation process.

3. Enter your app name, then select **Create** to launch the PowerApps Studio for web in a new browser tab, which creates a default app automatically based on the listâ€™s schema and data.

4. Your app is generated, and appears in a PowerApps Studio browser tab.
