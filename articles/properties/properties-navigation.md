# Navigation properties in PowerApps #

## Overview ##
Configure how the user scrolls through a gallery.

## Properties ##

**NavigationStep** How far a gallery scrolls if its **ShowNavigation** property is set to **true** and the user selects a navigation arrow at either end of that gallery.

**ShowNavigation** Whether an arrow appears at each end of a gallery so that a user can scroll through the items in the gallery by clicking or tapping an arrow.

**ShowScrollbar** Whether a scrollbar appears when the user hovers over a gallery.

**Snap** Whether, when a user scrolls through a gallery, it automatically snaps so that the next item appears in full.

**Transition** The visual effect (**Pop**, **Push**, or **None**) when the user hovers over an item in a gallery.
