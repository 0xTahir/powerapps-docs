# Text properties in PowerApps #

## Overview ##
Configure the text that appears on a control, in a tooltip, as a hint when the user types data, and specify other text-related characteristics.

## Properties ##

**AutoHeight** Whether a text box automatically increases its **Height** property if its **Text** property contains more characters than the control can show at one time.

**Clear** Whether a text-input control shows an "X" that the user can tap or click to clear the contents of that control.

**HintText** Light-grey text that appears in an input-text control if it's empty.

**HTMLText** Text that appears in an HTML text control and that may contain HTML tags.

**LineHeight** The distance between, for example, lines of text or items in a list.

**MaxLength** The number of characters that the user can type into a text-input control.

**Mode** Whether a text-input control is in **SingleLine**, **MultiLine**, or **Password** mode or a pen-input control is in **Draw**, **Erase**, or **Select** mode.

**Overflow** Whether a scrollbar appears in a text box if its **Wrap** property is set to **true** and the value of the control's **Text** property contains more characters than the control can show at one time.

**Text** Text that appears on a control or that the user types into a control.

**Tooltip** Explanatory text that appears when the user hovers over a control.

**Wrap** Whether text that's too long to fit in a text box wraps to the next line.
