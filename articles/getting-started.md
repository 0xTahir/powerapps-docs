# Get started with PowerApps #
Welcome to Microsoft PowerApps! Here are a few quick ways to start creating and using custom business apps.

## Discover possibilities ##
On the [PowerApps home page](https://web.powerapps.com), explore [sample apps](sample-app topic.md), which show fictitious data, or [featured apps](featured-app topic.md), which show live information from your data sources.

Review, add, and edit records in a default UI on a variety of devices. You don't need to install anything to get a quick sense of what's possible and how PowerApps could help your business. Each app is designed for a specific purpose, such as managing a budget, showcasing a set of products, and tracking sales opportunities. But you can customize any of these apps to match the exact scenario that your business needs.

## Give yourself a head start ##
When you're ready for more, [sign up for PowerApps](filename.md), and then [install PowerApps](https://web.powerapps.com/#/downloads) on a Windows tablet, laptop, or desktop computer. Now you can build an app automatically from a [template](get-started-test-drive) or [your data](get-started-create-from-data.md).

If you start from a template, PowerApps uploads sample data to your Dropbox, OneDrive, or Google Drive account and then generates the type of app you choose. Click around the app to see how it's configured, clear out the sample data to make the app your own, or use it as a sandbox for developing your PowerApps skills.

To create an app from your data, just point PowerApps at any of these sources:

- Excel files on Dropbox, OneDrive, or Google Drive
- SharePoint lists
- Salesforce or Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online records
- SQL Azure tables

PowerApps instantly generates a mobile app that has three screens: one each for browsing a list, viewing details, and adding/updating records.

## Take it up to full speed ##
No matter how you generate an app, go beyond the defaults by adding your own touches, such as more or different [data](filename.md), [screens](add-screen-context-variables.md), [controls](add-configure-controls.md), [behavior](formula-reference.md), or any combination of these. Customize the [kinds of data](filename.md) that the app shows, and specify how users [add and update records](filename.md). When the app does everything you need and more, [share it](filename.md) with others so that the entire organization can benefit from your creativity.
