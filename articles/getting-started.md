# Get started with PowerApps #
Welcome! [Sign up](signup-for-powerapps.md) to start creating and using custom business apps.

## Check out some apps ##
[Sign in](https://web.powerapps.com), and then explore a [sample app](open-and-run-a-sample-app.md) to get a quick sense of what's possible and how PowerApps could help your business.

Each sample app is designed for a specific purpose, such as managing a budget, showcasing a set of products, or tracking sales opportunities. Some sample apps contain fictitious data to inspire your thinking. Other sample apps connect to a live data source, such as Salesforce, so that you can show, add, and update your own records in real time.

If you create an app or a co-worker shares an app with you, you'll also find those apps on the home page for PowerApps.

## Try out a template ##
To create your own apps, [install PowerApps Studio for Windows](https://web.powerapps.com/#/downloads) on a tablet, laptop, or desktop computer.

You can get started quickly if you [build an app from a template](get-started-test-drive). These templates are based on fictitious data in a cloud account, such as Dropbox, OneDrive, or Google Drive. Explore specific screens and controls to understand how they're configured, and experiment with customization to boost your knowledge before you embark on your own apps.

## Generate an app from your data ##
Now that you have some idea of what PowerApps can do and a bit of experience, you can [automatically generate an app](get-started-create-from-data.md) that's designed specifically for your data, whether it's in:

- an Excel file (stored locally or in a cloud-storage account such as Dropbox, OneDrive, or Google Drive)
- a SharePoint list
- Salesforce or Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online
- a SQL Azure table

[AFD image tbd]

PowerApps creates a mobile app that has three screens: one each for browsing a list of records, viewing details about a specific record, and adding or updating records. Add your own touches by [choosing the kinds of data](add-gallery.md) that the app shows and [customizing how that data appears](add-form.md).

When your app looks and behaves the way you want, [share it](share-app.md) with others on your team so that they can use it too. Remember: they'll need access to the data source that you used to build the app.

## Get creative ##
You can create exactly the app you want with no distractions if you [build an app from scratch](get-started-create-from-blank.md). This way, the entire app comes straight from your brain to the screen. As you roll up your sleeves, you'll want to understand one or more of these concepts at a much deeper level:

- [formulas](formula-reference.md)
- [galleries and forms](working-with-forms.md)
- [tables and records](functions/working-with-tables.md)
- [controls and their properties](properties-reference.md)
