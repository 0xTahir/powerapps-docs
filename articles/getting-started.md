# Introduction to PowerApps #
Welcome! In PowerApps, you can generate an app automatically, customize it, create an app from scratch, and share and run apps that you create or that others create and share with you.

> **NOTE** If you've automatically generated an app from a SharePoint list, you can [customize the app](customize-layout-sharepoint.md) to better suit your needs.

## Generate an app automatically ##
To generate an app automatically, you just need to specify a data source, as this video demonstrates in under five minutes.

[AZURE.VIDEO nb:cid:UUID:9380084d-bc9a-484f-960e-4554c6bf67b2]

The video is based on an Excel workbook in the cloud, but you can also generate apps from other types of data sources, such as these:

- the [Microsoft Common Data Model](data-platform-intro.md)
- a custom SharePoint list
- a SQL Server database
- Salesforce
- Dynamics CRM

For step-by-step instructions, see [Create an app to manage data in SharePoint](app-from-sharepoint.md). Even though the topic is designed for SharePoint, the same principles apply to other types of data sources.

## Customize an app ##
If the generated app doesn't meet your needs by default, you can [customize it](customize-card.md). You might, for example, want to show data in a different kind of UI element (known as a control).

For ideas about how to improve your app further, you can [open a sample app](open-and-run-a-sample-app.md) to get a sense of what you can invent with some creativity and a bit of experience.

You can also [build an app from a template](get-started-test-drive.md). Each template is based on fictitious data in a cloud account, such as Dropbox, OneDrive, or Google Drive. Explore specific screens and controls to understand how they're configured, and experiment with customization to discover techniques that you can apply to your own apps.

## Create an app from scratch
After you've generated an app or two automatically and gained some experience with customization, you can [create an app from scratch](get-started-create-from-blank.md). By working from the ground up, you gain flexibility in app design, flow, and controls, and you can incorporate a larger variety of [data sources](connections-list.md).

For detailed explanations of some concepts you'll need, see these topics:

- [formulas](formula-reference.md)
- [galleries and forms](working-with-forms.md)
- [tables and records](working-with-tables.md)
- [controls and their properties](reference-properties.md)

## Share and run an app ##
When you finish your app, you can [share](share-app.md) it with others in your organization, and run either your own apps or shared apps in a [browser](run-app-browser.md) or on a [mobile device](run-app-client.md).
