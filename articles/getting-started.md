# Get started with PowerApps #
Welcome to Microsoft PowerApps! After you [sign up](filename.md), you can quickly start to create and use custom business apps.

## Discover possibilities ##
If you [sign in to the home page](filename.md) for PowerApps, you can [explore one or more sample apps](sample-app topic.md) to get a quick sense of what's possible and how PowerApps could help your business.

Each sample app is designed for a specific purpose such as managing a budget, showcasing a set of products, or tracking sales opportunities. Some sample apps contain hardcoded data that's fictitious but realistic enough to inspire your thinking. Other sample apps connect to a live data source such as Salesforce or Dynamics, so that you can show, add, and update real records in real time.

## Give yourself a head start ##
To see how any sample app is built, [install PowerApps](https://web.powerapps.com/#/downloads) on a tablet, laptop, or desktop computer that's running Windows. Explore specific screens and controls to understand how they're configured, and experiment with customization to boost your knowledge before you embark on your own apps.  

You can also [use a template](get-started-test-drive) to generate an app that's based on data in a cloud account, such as Dropbox, OneDrive or Google Drive.

## Hit the ground running ##
Now that you have some idea of what PowerApps can do and a bit of experience, you can [automatically generate an app that's designed specifically for your data](get-started-create-from-data.md), whether it's in:

- an Excel file (stored locally or in a cloud-storage account such as Dropbox, OneDrive, or Google Drive)
- a SharePoint list
- Salesforce or Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online
- a SQL Azure table

PowerApps creates a mobile app that has three screens: one each for browsing a list of records, viewing details about a specific record, and adding or updating records. At this point, add your own touches by [customizing the kinds of data](filename.md) that the app shows and [specifying how users add and update records](filename.md).

To make the app truly your own:

- [add another data source](filename.md)
- [add one or more screens](add-screen-context-variables.md)
- [add and configure more controls](add-configure-controls.md)
- [change how the app behaves](formula-reference.md)
- any combination of these

When the app does everything you need and more, [share it](filename.md) with others so that the entire organization can benefit from your creativity.

## Take it up to full speed ##
Create exactly the app you want with no distractions by [building an app from scratch](get-started-create-from-blank,md). This way, the entire app comes straight from your brain to the screen. With the training wheels off, you'll want to understand one or more of these concepts at a much deeper level:

- [formulas](filename.md)
- [galleries and forms](filename.md)
- [tables and records](filename.md)
- [data sources](filename.md)
- [properties](filename.md)
- [controls](filename.md)
