# Get started with PowerApps #
Welcome to Microsoft PowerApps! After you [sign up](filename.md), you can quickly start to create and use custom business apps.

## Discover possibilities ##
If you [sign in to the home page](filename.md) for PowerApps, you can [explore sample apps](sample-app topic.md) and [play with featured apps](featured-app topic.md). Without installing anything, you can get a quick sense of what's possible and how PowerApps could help your business.

Each sample app is designed for a specific purpose such as managing a budget, showcasing a set of products, or tracking sales opportunities. These apps show data that's fictitious but realistic enough to inspire your thinking. In a featured app, you connect to a live data source such as Salesforce or Dynamics, and you can show, add, and update real records in real time.

## Give yourself a head start ##

When you're ready for more, [install PowerApps](https://web.powerapps.com/#/downloads) on a tablet, laptop, or desktop computer that's running Windows. Now you can [use a template](get-started-test-drive) to generate an app that looks like a sample app, but you can customize the UI and replace the fictitious data with real data.

If you take this approach, PowerApps uploads sample data to your Dropbox, OneDrive, or Google Drive account and then generates the type of app you choose. Click around the generated app to see how it's configured, clear out the sample data to make the app your own, or use it as a sandbox for developing your PowerApps skills.

## Hit the ground running ##
Now that you have some idea of what PowerApps can do and a bit of experience, you can [automatically generate an app that's designed specifically for your data](get-started-create-from-data.md), whether it's in:

- an Excel file (stored locally or in a cloud-storage account such as Dropbox, OneDrive, or Google Drive)
- a SharePoint list
- Salesforce or Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online
- a SQL Azure table

PowerApps creates a mobile app that has three screens: one each for browsing a list of records, viewing details about a specific record, and adding or updating records. At this point, add your own touches by [customizing the kinds of data](filename.md) that the app shows and [specifying how users add and update records](filename.md).

To make the app truly your own:

- [add another data source](filename.md)
- [add one or more screens](add-screen-context-variables.md)
- [add and configure more controls](add-configure-controls.md)
- [change how the app behaves](formula-reference.md)
- any combination of these

When the app does everything you need and more, [share it](filename.md) with others so that the entire organization can benefit from your creativity.

## Take it up to full speed ##
Create exactly the app you want with no distractions by [building an app from scratch](get-started-create-from-blank,md). This way, the entire app comes straight from your brain to the screen. With the training wheels off, you'll want to understand one or more of these concepts at a much deeper level:

- [formulas](filename.md)
- [galleries and forms](filename.md)
- [tables and records](filename.md)
- [data sources](filename.md)
- [properties](filename.md)
- [controls](filename.md)
