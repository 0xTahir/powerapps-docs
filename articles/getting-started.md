# Get started with PowerApps #
Welcome! If you've never created an app in PowerApps before, you might want to start by generating a simple app automatically from a data source that you specify. To understand what this process looks like, **watch this video**. It's less than three minutes long and introduces not only automatic app generation but also the Microsoft Common Data Model.

[AZURE.VIDEO nb:cid:UUID:e0d83908-aedd-4db3-8ea9-2dbd4695c662]

The Common Data Model is one type of data source, but the process is similar for to any [supported data source](connection-list.md), such as these:

- SharePoint
- SQL Server
- Salesforce
- Dynamics CRM
- an Excel workbook in the cloud

After you generate an app, you can customize it to better suit your needs, or you can build your own app from scratch. To understand how you might build an app from scratch, **watch this video**.

## Open PowerApps ##
When you're ready to start generating, customizing, and building your own apps, [open powerapps.com](https://web.powerapps.com), and then follow the prompts to sign up by providing credentials for a work or school account.

**Note**: If you have trouble, make sure that you're signing up with a [supported type of account](signup-for-powerapps.md).

On the **Home** tab of [powerapps.com](https://web.powerapps.com), click or tap **New app** at the bottom of the left navigation bar. In the dialog box that appears, you can choose either of these options (depending on your platform):

- install PowerApps from the Windows Store
- open PowerApps in a browser

**Note**: You can do most of the same things in either version, but you can [review the differences](create-app-browser.md).

In PowerApps, click or tap the **New** tab in the left navigation bar. On that tab, you can



you'll see a tile for each app that you've created or that someone else has shared with you. You can also explore a variety of [sample apps](open-and-run-a-sample-app.md) that show the kinds of apps that you can create in PowerApps.

## Generate an app from your data ##
To create your own apps, [install PowerApps Studio](https://web.powerapps.com/#/downloads) on a computer that's running Windows 8.1 or Windows 10, or .

You can [automatically generate an app](get-started-create-from-data.md) that's designed specifically for your data, whether it's in:

- an Excel file in a cloud-storage account such as Dropbox, OneDrive, or Google Drive
- a SharePoint list
- Salesforce or Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online
- SQL Server
- [the Microsoft Common Data Model](data-platform-intro.md) (preview)

**Watch this video for a quick demo**:

[AZURE.VIDEO nb:cid:UUID:9380084d-bc9a-484f-960e-4554c6bf67b2]

PowerApps creates a mobile app that has three screens: one each for browsing a list of records, viewing details about a specific record, and adding or updating records. Add your own touches by [customizing the app](get-started-create-from-data.md#change-the-app-layout).

When your app looks and behaves the way you want, [share it](share-app.md) with others on your team so that they can use it too. Remember: they'll need access to the data source that you used to build the app.

## Try out a template ##
You can also [build an app from a template](get-started-test-drive.md). These templates are based on fictitious data in a cloud account, such as Dropbox, OneDrive, or Google Drive. Explore specific screens and controls to understand how they're configured, and experiment with customization to build expertise that you can apply to your own apps.  

## Get creative ##
You can create exactly the app you want with no distractions if you [build an app from scratch](get-started-create-from-blank.md). This way, the entire app comes straight from your brain to the screen. As you roll up your sleeves, you'll want to understand one or more of these concepts at a much deeper level:

- [formulas](formula-reference.md)
- [galleries and forms](working-with-forms.md)
- [tables and records](working-with-tables.md)
- [controls and their properties](reference-properties.md)
