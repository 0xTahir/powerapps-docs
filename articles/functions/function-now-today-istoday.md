# Now, Today, and IsToday functions in PowerApps #

Returns the current date and time, and tests whether a date/time value is today.

## Description ##

The **Now** function returns the current date and time as a date/time value.

The **Today** function returns the current date as a date/time value. The time portion is midnight. **Today** has the same value throughout a day, from midnight today to midnight tomorrow.

The **IsToday** function tests whether a date/time value is between midnight today and midnight tomorrow. This function returns a Boolean **true** or **false** value.

All these functions work with the local time of the current user.
