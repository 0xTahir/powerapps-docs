# Self-service sign up for PowerApps #
Signing up for PowerApps, as an individual, is easy! You can choose to use a PowerApps trial account, purchase PowerApps Plan 1, or purchase PowerApps Plan 2, even if you are in an existing organization. Once you have determined which you would like to use, this article will walk you through the steps to get up and running.

For administration information, see [Purchase PowerApps for your organization](signup-for-powerapps-admin.md) or [PowerApps in your organization Q&A](signup-question-and-answer.md).

> **NOTE** If you are in an organization, individual sign up may be disabled. See [Individual signup has been turned off](#Individual-sign-up-turned-off) (in this topic) for more information if you get an error indicating it has been turned off.

## Individual signup has been turned off ##
When trying to sign up for PowerApps, you may encounter the following message.

<@ricksal Need this in a gray box> Your IT department has turned off signup for PowerApps.

  ![](./media/signup-for-powerapps/Individual-sign-up-turned-off.png)

This could be because your organization has disabled individual sign ups. It could also be because you purchased Office 365 through a partner. Learn more.

If your organization has disabled individual sign ups, you will need to work with your IT group to get a PowerApps license assigned to your account in order to continue.

## Troubleshoot ##
In many cases, you register for PowerApps by following the sign-up steps in this topic. However, sign-up may fail because of any of several reasons. The following table summarizes some of the most common reasons and ways you can workaround these issues.

| Symptom / Error Message |Cause and Workaround|
|---|---|
| **Personal email addresses (e.g. nancy@gmail.com)** <br> <br> You receive a message like the following during signup: <br> <br> `You entered a personal email address: Please enter your work email address so we can securely store your company's data.` <br> <br> or <br> <br> `That looks like a personal email address. Enter your work address so we can connect you with others in your company. And don’t worry. We won’t share your address with anyone.`| PowerApps does not support email addresses provided by consumer email services or telecommunications providers. <br> <br> To complete signup, try again using an email address assigned by your work or school.|
| **.gov or .mil email addresses** <br> <br> You receive a message like the following during signup: <br> <br> `PowerApps unavailable: PowerApps is not available for users with .gov or .mil email addresses at this time. Use another work email address or check back later.` <br> <br> or <br> <br> `We can't finish signing you up. It looks like Microsoft PowerApps isn't currently available for your work or school.` | PowerApps does not support .gov or .mil addresses at this time.|
| **Self-service signup disabled** <br> <br> You receive a message like the following during signup: <br> <br> `We can't finish signing you up. Your IT department has turned off signup for Microsoft PowerApps. Contact them to complete signup.` <br> <br> or <br> <br> `That looks like a personal email address. Enter your work address so we can connect you with others in your company. And don’t worry. We won’t share your address with anyone.` | Your organization’s IT administrator has disabled self-service signup for PowerApps. <br> <br> To complete signup, contact your IT administrator and ask them to allow existing users to sign up for PowerApps and to allow new users to join your existing tenant.|
| **Email address is not an Office 365 ID** <br> <br>  You receive a message like the following during signup: <br> <br> `We can't find you at contoso.com.  Do you use a different ID at work or school? Try signing in with that, and if it doesn't work, contact your IT department.` | Your organization uses IDs to sign in to Office 365 and other Microsoft services that are different than your email address.  For example, your email address might be Nancy.Smith@contoso.com but your ID is nancys@contoso.com. <br> <br> To complete signup, use the ID that your organization has assigned to for signing in to Office 365 or other Microsoft services.  If you don't know what this is, contact your IT administrator. |
