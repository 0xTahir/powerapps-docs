# Connect to data in your organization #

Create an app to manage your organization's data, from sources such as SalesForce and an on-premise server that's running SQL Server. By setting your organization up with Microsoft PowerApps Enterprise, an IT administrator can make this data available to you and other business users, in addition to performing these tasks:
- Manage PowerApps within your organization, including managing user access.
- Create APIs that connect to specific sources of organizational data.
- Manage permissions for the APIs and connections.

To set an organization up with Microsoft PowerApps Enterprise, administrators [get started](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/powerapps-get-started-azure-portal), [add APIs and connections](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/powerapps-develop-api), and [monitor PowerApps](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/powerapps-manage-monitor-usage). After the organization is set up, administrators can configure connections to data in a [SQL database on-premise](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/powerapps-create-api-sqlserver) and [Salesforce](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/powerapps-create-api-salesforce).
