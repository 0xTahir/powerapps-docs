# Gallery control in PowerApps #
[AZURE.INCLUDE [control-summary-gallery](../../includes/control-summary-gallery.md)]

## Description ##
A gallery can show records from a data source, and each record can contain multiple types of data. For example, a gallery can show contact information that includes a name, an address, and a phone number for each contact. Each type of information appears in a separate control, and you configure those controls in the gallery template. The template appears on the left edge of a horizontal/landscape gallery and at the top of a vertical/portrait gallery. Any changes that you make in the template are reflected throughout the gallery.
