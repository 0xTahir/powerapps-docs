# Take a quick tour of PowerApps on a phone #

Run an app that someone else created, or create your own app with a default interface and sample data in less than a minute. To create your own app, just specify a cloud-storage account to which PowerApps can upload data, and then choose any of several types of apps that PowerApps can create for you. Try out your new app by adding, updating, and removing data, and share the app with others in your organization.

## Run an app ##
To run an app that another user has created and shared with you:
1. [Install PowerApps](http://aka.ms/powerappsinstall), and then follow any of these steps:
	- Select **Open in PowerApps** in the notification mail that you received.
	- Open PowerApps directly, and then select the app in the list that appears on the default screen.
	- In [powerapps.com](https://web.powerapps.com), select **Apps** near the left edge, select the app you want to run, and then select **Open**.

1. If prompted, select **Add** next to one or more data sources, provide your credentials, and then select **Launch**.

## Create an app ##

1. Get a Dropbox, OneDrive, or GoogleDrive account if you don't already have one, and [install PowerApps](http://aka.ms/powerappsinstall).

1. Select the arrow in the upper-right corner, type a name for your app, and then select **Create**.

	![Create your app](./media/quick-tour-phone/create-app.png)

	The sample data is uploaded to your cloud account, and the app is created and ready for use.

1. Explore the default behavior and appearance of the app, and then swipe right to close it.

## Share an app ##
**Note:** Before anyone else can run or customize your app, you must [share the sample data](share-app-data.md) with them.

1. Follow the procedure to create an app, earlier in this topic.

1. Near the bottom of the screen, select **Open** to display a list of apps that you can share, and then select the details icon to the right of the app you want to share.

	![Choose the app to share](./media/quick-tour-phone/choose-app.png)

1. Select the **Share** icon, and then type the name or email address of one or more people with whom you want to share the app.

	![Share your app](./media/quick-tour-phone/share-app.png)

1. In the list of permissions, select one of these options:

	- **Can view** to allow users to run the app but not customize it.
	- **Can edit** to allow users to customize and share the app.

1. Edit the default notification message, and then select **Share**.

1. Select **Close** to dismiss the success notification.

	The people with whom you shared your app will receive an email message that contains a link to install PowerApps and run your app.
