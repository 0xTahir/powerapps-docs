# Take a quick tour of PowerApps on a phone #

Create an app with a default interface and sample data in less than a minute. Just specify a cloud-storage account to which PowerApps can upload data, and then choose any of several types of apps that PowerApps can create for you. Save the app, and then specify other users who can run your app (or even customize it for themselves).

**Prerequisites**

- An account on DropBox, OneDrive, or GoogleDrive

## Connect to the cloud ##

1. Install [PowerApps](http://aka.ms/powerappsinstall).

1. Open PowerApps, swipe left to advance through the welcome screens, and then provide your credentials to sign in.

1. Near the bottom of the screen, select **Connections**, and then select **Add a connection**.

1. In the list of connection types, select **Dropbox**, **Google Drive**, or **OneDrive**.

1. Select **Connect**, and then provide your credentials.

## Create an app ##

1. Near the bottom of the screen, select **New**, and then select **Start from a template**.

1. Scroll through the list of templates, and then select a template (such as **Event Signup**).

1. Select the arrow in the upper-right corner, type a name for your app, and then select **Create**.

	The sample data is uploaded to your cloud account, and the app is created and ready for use.

1. Explore the default look and feel of the app, and then swipe right to close it.

## Share an app ##
**Note:** Before anyone else can run or customize your app, you must [share the sample data](share-app-data.md) with them.

1. Near the bottom of the screen, select **Open** to display a list of apps that you can share.

1. Select the Details icon to the right of the app you want to share.

1. Select the **Share** icon, and then type the name or email address of one or more people with whom you want to share the app.

1. In the list of permissions, select one of these options:

	- **Can view** to allow users to run the app but not customize it.
	- **Can edit** to allow users to customize and share the app.

1. Edit the default notification message, and then select **Share**.

1. Select **Close** to dismiss the success notification.

	The people with whom you shared your app will receive an email message that contains a link that they can select to install PowerApps and run your app.

## Run an app ##
- If you received a message that someone has shared an app with you:

	1. Select the **Open in PowerApps** link in the message.
	2.
