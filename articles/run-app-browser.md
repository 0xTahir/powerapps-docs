# Using PowerApps in a web browser #
You can run all your Dynamics 365 apps in a web browser. All your apps can quickly be accessed via the homepage portal or the task pane.

For PowerApps, the following browser versions are supported:
* Microsoft Edge
* Internet Explorer 11 and above
* Chrome 47.x and above
* Safari on iOS 9.3 and above
* Firefox 47 and above

For apps shared with you, you will be notified by email. You can launch the app in the browser by clicking on the app link in the email.

## Dynamics 365 homepage portal ##

The homepage portal is the home to all your Dynamics 365 apps.  It can be accessed via the Dynamics 365 button in your Office 365 waffle.  

Once you are on the home page you can see your pinned apps as well as all apps that you have installed or were pushed to you by the administrator. Simply click on an app tile to launch the app or the ellipsis to find out more details about the app.

If you are having trouble finding an app, start entering the app name into the **search box** to filter your app list.  You can also filter by app environment in the **Filter** pane.

If you have recently installed a new app it may not show in your app list immediately.  Clicking on **Refresh** will ensure that your app list is updated with all your apps.  Note that this process may take up to a minute.

## Task pane ##

The task pane gives you quick access to all your apps.  It is accessed by clicking on the Dynamics 365 toggle-button on the Dynamics 365 header, which is visible on top of all your Dynamics 365 apps.

You can quickly launch one of your pinned apps from the task pane or find any of your apps via "My apps" sub-menu.


## Pinning an app ##

Quickly access your favorite apps from both the homepage and the task pane by pinning them.  To pin an app select "Pin app" from the ellipsis menu on the app tile in both the task pane and the home page.

## Launching an app ##
To launch an app simply click on its tile on either the Dynamics 365 home page portal or the task pane.

You can also access an app directly via its URL.  This allows you to share apps via email links as well as bookmark them in your web browser.

If your browser does not support all controls, once the app is running inside the browser, you can switch to the native client on iOS, Android or Windows by choosing the download option in the Dynamics 365 header.  

## Sign in to PowerApps ##
If the app is opened from dynamics.com, chances are you already signed in to Dynamics 365. If you are launching the app from the web link, you will be prompted to sign in using your Azure Active Directory credentials.

## Give consent ##
If the app requires a connection to a data source or requires consent to use device capabilities, you will be prompted for the configuration before you use the app:  

![Connection](./media/run-app-browser/app-connection.png)

Typically, you are only prompted the first time.

## Exit PowerApps ##
There are several ways you can exit or close the app:
1. Choose Sign out from the top right on the Dynamics 365 app header.
2. Select the Dynamics 365 navigation menu to navigate to home or run another app.
