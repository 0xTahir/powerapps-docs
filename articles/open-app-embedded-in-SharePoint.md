# Open app from a SharePoint Online list
In a SharePoint Online list, open an existing app that manages the list.

## Open the app ##

You can **Open** an existing app inside SharePoint Online and manage a list.

As of this writing, PowerApps supports custom lists but not libraries. In addition, you can show data in some types of columns, such as **Choice** and **Picture**, but you can't update that data. For more information, see [Known issues](connection-sharepoint-online.md#known-issues)

## Open the app

1. **Open** your SharePoint Online list and select an app from the list.
