# Test drive KratosApps

## Sign in and open KratosApps ##
1. Perform either of these steps:
	- If someone shared an app with you or invited you to try the product, click the link in the email message.
	- If you found the product in a search engine or the Windows Store, click the result.
1. Type your email address, and then click **Sign up**.
1. Open the email message from the Microsoft Office 365 Team, and then click the link to finish signing up.
1. Specify your country or region, your full name, and your password.
1. Specify your password again, and then click **Start**.

	KratosApps opens.

1. (optional) If someone shared an app with you, run it, and then click **New** in the left navigation bar when you're ready to explore KratosApps further.

## Explore and customize an app ##
1. Under **Start from Template**, click **Get started**.
1. In the list of template categories, click **Events & Calendar**, and then click **Event SignUp**.
1. Specify where you want to store the data for your app (for example, DropBox).

	The template opens in the default workspace, where you can customize the app that's based on the **Event SignUp** template. Before you make any changes though, you'll explore the app as it already exists by opening **Preview**. In the default workspace, you can make changes, but the app doesn't behave exactly the same as if a user were running it. In **Preview**, you can't make changes, but you can verify whether the app behaves as you expect.

	After the splash screen appears for a few seconds, the screen for registering a volunteer appears.

1. Press F5 (or click the right arrow in the upper-right corner) to open Preview.
1. Specify a name, an email address, and a phone number.

	This information doesn't have to be real.

1. Click a t-shirt size, and then click **Next**.
