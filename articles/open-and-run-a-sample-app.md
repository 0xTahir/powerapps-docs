# Open and run a sample app #
In [powerapps.com](http://web.powerapps.com), you can access two types of sample apps:

- Apps such as **Cost Estimator** contain sample data.

	![Sample app with sample data](./media/open-and-run-a-sample-app/sample-app-with-sample-data.png)

- Apps such as **Opportunity Tracker** connect to your live data in a Salesforce or other account.
