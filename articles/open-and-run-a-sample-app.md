# Use a sample app #
In [powerapps.com](http://web.powerapps.com), use a sample app to explore design possibilities and discover concepts that you can apply as you develop your own apps. Each sample app uses fictitious data to showcase a real-world scenario.

In **Cost Estimator**, for example, you can create an appointment for estimating the cost of installing a flooring product in a room of a particular size. Capture details such as address and square footage, and calculate the price based on discounts and tax rates. Filter a list of appointments to show those for which estimates have been created, for which estimates haven't been created, or all appointments.

## Open the app ##
1. Sign in to [powerapps.com](https://web.powerapps.com), and then click or tap **Cost Estimator** in the list of sample apps.
