# Add a condition to a logic flow #

Logic flows can contain conditions, which means that they can check some value and execute steps only if that value is something you specifically want. 

**Prerequisites**

- An Office 365 account (from which you can send email)

## Adding the condition ##

1. In Chrome, open [the PowerApps portal](https://portal.kratosapps.com/), and then click **Flows** in the left navigation bar.

2. In the list of Logic Flows, click the edit icon, which looks like a pencil, next to the Logic Flow that you want to add a condition to.

3. At the bottom of the flow, click the plus button and select **Add Condition**.
