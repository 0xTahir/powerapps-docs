# Review the first section

Let's do a quick review of what you learned in the first section.

**PowerApps** is a collection of software services, apps, and data connectors that work together to fundamentally transform and accelerate how you build and share custom line of business applications.

PowerApps connects to the **cloud services and data sources** you're already using, giving you the ability to **quickly build apps** that suit specific needsâ€”without writing code or struggling with integration issues. Apps can be shared instantly with your co-workers across web, tablets, and mobile devices. PowerApps also integrates with **Microsoft Flow**, making it possible to trigger workflows from within apps.

There are several features that make up PowerApps and a set of related technologies that make it even more powerful.

The easiest ways to get started with PowerApps are to run the samples, play around with the templates, and generate apps from your own data. You will gain confidence with building apps, and will be sharing them out in no time.
