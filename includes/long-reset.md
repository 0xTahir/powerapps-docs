- You can, for example, set the **OnSelect**  property of a button so that, when a user selects it, the value of a context variable is changed to **true** and then set the **Reset** property of another control, such as a list, to the name of the context variable. By taking this approach, the list would revert to its default value whenever the user selects the button.
